the man in the morgue
season 1, episode 19
vo: even all these months after katrina ravaged the city of new orleans, human remains are still being found in devastated neighborhoods across the city. cadaver dogs are being used to search for 2,300 people still unaccounted for. makeshift morgues still exist in warehouses, schools and churches throughout the area.
the camera pulls back to reveal a small television set in just such a makeshift warehouse morgue.
int. temporary morgue - st. gabriel, louisiana dozens of people in blue scrubs are examining cadavers. the camera travels from one room to another with seemingly no end of dead bodies.
vo: officials are finally beginning to admit what many people have known since the levees broke long ago - many of these people will never be found.
mike doyle, an orderly, is wheeling a body from one room to another. dr. graham legiere, the medical examiner, joins him as he walks past. they continue their conversation as they walk.

mike doyle: oh, yeah. late and nasty.
graham legiere: same kinky creature?
mike doyle: doc, the girl, carrie's, a serious perv swerve.
mike pushes the body into an autopsy room. he stops in front of brennan who is writing up her notes in a chart on another body. she smiles listening to the conversation.
graham legiere: feeling wrong feels so good.
mike doyle: it's... (stops when he notices brennan listening) hey, sorry, dr. brennan.

graham legiere: you know there are reasons they call this the big easy even after hurricane katrina.
he tries to rest his hand on a tray with surgical instruments but knocks the tray off. everything crashes to the floor. brennan looks up shocked by the noise and laughs a little.
dr. james embry, assistant to the medical examiner, enters the room with a file pertaining to the body brennan has been looking at. he is followed by detective harding and a uniformed police officer.
james embry: dr. brennan, meet john doe 361.

brennan and james shake their head in disbelief.
detective harding: god, graham. thinking about sex in this place should be illegal, if it ain't already.

sam nods his head and comes into the room to take john doe 361 for x-rays. brennan is covering the body with plastic as graham talks to her.

detective harding, with her notebook in hand, exits the room.
cut to: int. graham legiere home - upstairs hallway booth and brennan are waiting down the hall near the top of the stairs. detective harding approaches them.

detective harding: tell you what, dr. brennan, i'm going to ask the questions.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: oh, come on, detective. she was working with the guy.
detective harding: how closely?

detective harding: answer my question, please. what brought you here? was it a social call? business? revenge kill?
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: look, legiere bought some black gum root from the voodoo store. we just stopped by to ask why.

while brennan is talking to harding, booth looks on the floor and sees brennan's lost earring by the leg of a hall table. he doesn't say anything to either brennan or harding that he's seen it.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: day before yesterday, i showed a voodoo expert a mojo that graham found lodged in the mouth of john doe 361.
detective harding: this, uh, voodoo consultation, did it occur before or after amnesia.

a policewoman #1 enters the hall from the bedroom and comes up behind detective harding while she speaks. she has something in her hand.
detective harding: so graham made voodoo spells, shoved them into corpses' mouths, then pretended to be surprised when he found them?
booth sees the policewoman and what she has in her hands.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: what's that?
policewoman #1: ma'am?
harding turns her back to booth and brennan to examine was the policewoman as brought. brennan moves closer to get a better look leaving booth alone and unnoticed. he bends down while they're talking, picks up brennan's earring and puts it in his pocket.
detective harding: split cast, huh? more voodoo. just like the symbol on the wall? bag it as evidence.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: secte rouge?

he takes brennan's arm and begins to drag her toward the stairs. harding's words stop them.
detective harding: i'm gonna tear this place apart. if i find one piece of evidence that ties you to this scene, i will take you into custody.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: wait, do you really think that someone could go into a trance, commit a murder like that, and not remember it?
detective harding: no, i don't. but i sure as hell think someone can fake amnesia.

james embry: legiere's body. is it, uh, as bad as they say?

['zack', 'zach', 'zack addy', 'zach addy', 'dr. addy', 'dr addy', 'z. addy', 'zack a', 'zackk', 'zaky', 'dr. zack', 'doc addy']: (o.s.) that makes no sense.

booth switches off the phone while he watches sam perform his prayer ritual. sam's chanting is louder.

sam potter: those spells are the work of a sorcerer. priests houngans can make healing mojos, but i'm not allowed.

brennan looks at the snake and touches it.
sam potter: the snake pulls the evil out of the soul freeing the spirit, the loua. i must do what small things i can. the floods washed away too much of what was good.
booth sees brennan handling the snake.

he pulls brennan away from handling the snake.

cut to: int. jeffersonian - medico-legal lab zack is looking through a magnifying glass as hodgins comes up behind him. he stays behind him during the entire scene.
['hodgins', 'jack hodgins', 'jack', 'dr. hodgins', 'dr hodgins', 'dr. jack', 'mr. hodgins', 'hodges', 'hodg', 'jack h', 'hodginz', 'dr hodges']: i've been over every inch of these x-rays.
['zack', 'zach', 'zack addy', 'zach addy', 'dr. addy', 'dr addy', 'z. addy', 'zack a', 'zackk', 'zaky', 'dr. zack', 'doc addy']: me, too.
['hodgins', 'jack hodgins', 'jack', 'dr. hodgins', 'dr hodgins', 'dr. jack', 'mr. hodgins', 'hodges', 'hodg', 'jack h', 'hodginz', 'dr hodges']: there's evidence of particles on the bones, but there is no way for me to know what they are.
['zack', 'zach', 'zack addy', 'zach addy', 'dr. addy', 'dr addy', 'z. addy', 'zack a', 'zackk', 'zaky', 'dr. zack', 'doc addy']: probably dirt.
hodgins is not pleased with zack's use of the word "dirt."
['hodgins', 'jack hodgins', 'jack', 'dr. hodgins', 'dr hodgins', 'dr. jack', 'mr. hodgins', 'hodges', 'hodg', 'jack h', 'hodginz', 'dr hodges']: yes, thank you, zack. but dirt is a meaningless word.
zack is concentrating on an x-ray and doesn't respond to hodgins' comment.
['zack', 'zach', 'zack addy', 'zach addy', 'dr. addy', 'dr addy', 'z. addy', 'zack a', 'zackk', 'zaky', 'dr. zack', 'doc addy']: you can't see air on an x-ray.
['hodgins', 'jack hodgins', 'jack', 'dr. hodgins', 'dr hodgins', 'dr. jack', 'mr. hodgins', 'hodges', 'hodg', 'jack h', 'hodginz', 'dr hodges']: what? i never said you could. i'm not even talking about air.
['zack', 'zach', 'zack addy', 'zach addy', 'dr. addy', 'dr addy', 'z. addy', 'zack a', 'zackk', 'zaky', 'dr. zack', 'doc addy']: you can see a space where air might be like a cavity, but not the air itself.
['hodgins', 'jack hodgins', 'jack', 'dr. hodgins', 'dr hodgins', 'dr. jack', 'mr. hodgins', 'hodges', 'hodg', 'jack h', 'hodginz', 'dr hodges']: what i'm saying is that yes, there are flecks on the x-rays that might be dirt, but that doesn't tell us anything.
hodgins is getting mad that zack isn't paying attention to him. he jerks zack around in his chair so he can see his face.
['hodgins', 'jack hodgins', 'jack', 'dr. hodgins', 'dr hodgins', 'dr. jack', 'mr. hodgins', 'hodges', 'hodg', 'jack h', 'hodginz', 'dr hodges']: is it sandy? hm? silty, "humusey"? is it clay? is it more organic than mineral? is it soil? is it pulverized gravel? what minerals are in it? are the minerals crystalline? see, these are all details a person cannot get off an x-ray no matter how long he stares at it.
zack has slowly drifted off during hodgins speech and is obviously thinking about something else.

the door bursts open and detective harding rushes in with her gun drawn, several other policemen behind her also with gun. booth turns to face her pulling his own weapon out.
detective harding: put down your weapon, agent booth.
they face each other, gun pointing at each other.

detective harding: i'm here to arrest dr. brennan for the murder of graham legiere.

detective harding: traces of dr. brennan's blood in legiere's home, legiere's blood on her clothing from the clinic.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: is that it?

brennan steps around booth and offers herself up to harding.

harding shoves brennan out of the room. everyone but booth follows. booth sighs, turns in a circle and then stops. he reaches in his pocket, pulls out her earring, looks at it, tosses it in the air and catches it. he looks up, seemingly to god, appearing to ask what to do next.

(harding stops her from touching it) room and... i'm assuming the person who left it there is trying to frame me so the tooth is probably graham's.
carolyn julian: three degrees and still a fool. (to harding) this interview is over, rose. i need to speak with my client alone before she gives herself a lethal injection.
detective harding: of course. of course. (as she exits) it's nice seeing you again, carolyn.

carolyn julian: you sew those lips together, girl, because there is no such thing as "help" in the new orleans police. they just want to close the case as quickly and easily as they can. and you are making it christmas time for them.

harding looks back and forth between brennan and sam like they're crazy. finally, she relents.
detective harding: fine. fine. go ahead.
sam holds the pot up toward the sky and begins a voodoo chant. at the appropriate time, he stops, opens the pot and pours some ashes on the body. there is a reaction from the ashes and a design begins to be revealed on the ribcage.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: whoa! did you see that?

booth paces, thinking. he finally figures out where he knows that pattern from.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: electrostatic, my ass. that was part of an emblem of a 1959 caddy brougham. oh, boy.

cut to: int. voodoo shop - ponchartrain avenue - day there's a close-up of the picture of richard benoit and his daughter in front of his cadillac. the camera zooms back to reveal benoit. booth, brennan and detective harding are in the shop as well.
richard benoit: you're taking my caddy? why?
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: why? because we have reason to believe that your caddy was used in the wrongful death of rene mouton.
richard benoit: you think that someone did a hit-and-run on rene mouton in my caddy?
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: yes!

richard benoit: yeah.
booth whistles and gestures for detective harding to show him a picture. she hands it to richard benoit.
detective harding: this him?
benoit takes the picture and we see that it's a picture of mike doyle.
richard benoit: mike doyle. yeah. why?
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: we need to speak to your daughter.
detective harding clears her throat interrupting booth.

richard benoit: i don't know where she is.
detective harding: mr. benoit, right now she's a suspect in the murder of mike doyle.
richard benoit: why would eva kill her boyfriend?
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: it's hard to explain.

richard benoit: no, no.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: i bet there are drugs in this shop that could knock me out, make me forget.
booth, brennan and harding stare at benoit and each other as he processes this information. he exhales and finally decides he will cooperate.
richard benoit: eva is downstairs praying.
benoit leads them toward the door to the basement.
cut to: int. voodoo shop -stairs and door to basement room the group comes down the stairs and stops outside a door to the basement room.
richard benoit: eva? eva, open the door.
there's no answer. detective harding puts her ear against the door, then turns the knob and enters. booth enters after her. benoit sees something.
richard benoit: no. eva. no!
he races into the room cut to: int. voodoo shop - basement room benoit runs toward his daughter, eva, who is impaled through her chest on a long spike protruding from the wall.
richard benoit: eva! eva!
he slowly pulls her off the stake and lowers her to the floor.
richard benoit: oh, no. no.
brennan walks past them to study the altar that is set up at the end of the room. she calls to booth.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: booth?
he goes to where she is and sees what she's looking at. there is a skull on the altar.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: could that be mouton's skull?
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: yes. and this (picks up spike) could be the spike she used on mouton and mike doyle.
flash cut to: b/w wall with spike image, blood dripping down, sound of screams flash cut to: int. voodoo shop - basement room some time has passed because sam potter and james embry have shown up. eva is now on a gurney.
sam potter: (looking over the room) this is the lair of a bokor, someone who can call the dark spirits. (points at spike in wall) this is used for animal sacrifice.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: it was heated to red hot first to cauterize the wound so it wouldn't bleed.

brennan crosses to the body and examines it.
james embry: sternum, heart, through the chest cavity, through the spine.
sam potter: (at altar) can i open this?
detective harding: why?
there are containers on the altar. he points to a few.
sam potter: this one holds the soul of mr. rene mouton. i believe this one holds the soul of the bokor.
richard benoit: why don't you just shut up?
sam potter: i would like to release mr. mouton's soul so no other bokor can use it.
detective harding: no. it's evidence. don't touch it.
richard benoit: i raised my eva to be a houngan, a healer. how could this happen right underneath my nose?
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: rebellious adolescent? do you remember how much of the spike was protruding from her back when we first came in?

james embry: no, it might even make it harder.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: (thinks a moment) eva benoit did not commit su1c1de.
detective harding: based on what?
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: this room isn't even 12 feet wide. even if she ran at full speed and her aim was perfect, no way the spike would go through her spine unless she was pushed onto it.
sam stares at richard benoit and gets closer to him.
sam potter: (re benoit) he is the sorcerer. he believes he can bring her back to life.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: okay. everyone just simmer down. okay, you're saying that he murder his daughter thinking that he could bring her back to life?

brennan grabs benoit's shirt and tugs. buttons fly off and his torso is exposed revealing a bandaged wound. brennan steps back.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: there's your kill.

harding cuffs benoit as booth and brennan begin to leave. benoit calls to her and they turn back.
richard benoit: dr. temperance brennan, you leave here, you go home, it does not matter. there are powers, dark powers to whom distance makes no difference.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: easy, buddy.

benoit keeps chanting and finishes by blowing out a long breath of air toward brennan. brennan reaches forward and using two fingers, pokes his eyes. benoit screams in pain.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: i've noticed that very few people are scary once they've been poked in the eye.
