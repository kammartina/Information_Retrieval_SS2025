zack (offscreen): i'm on it.
[brennan turns to stare at booth. booth shakes his head, standing in front of a headstone not unlike kent's. brennan joins him at his side.]

['zack', 'zach', 'zack addy', 'zach addy', 'dr. addy', 'dr addy', 'z. addy', 'zack a', 'zackk', 'zaky', 'dr. zack', 'doc addy']: he made 46.4% of his three point attempts in his last season.
['goodman', 'dr. goodman', 'dr goodman', 'daniel goodman', 'director goodman', 'dr. daniel', 'professor goodman']: a basketball fan? i'm surprised, mr. addy.

['goodman', 'dr. goodman', 'dr goodman', 'daniel goodman', 'director goodman', 'dr. daniel', 'professor goodman']: it's difficult knowing kent will never play again. makes the war so real.
['hodgins', 'jack hodgins', 'jack', 'dr. hodgins', 'dr hodgins', 'dr. jack', 'mr. hodgins', 'hodges', 'hodg', 'jack h', 'hodginz', 'dr hodges']: which is odd since it was all fiction that got us there in the first place.
['goodman', 'dr. goodman', 'dr goodman', 'daniel goodman', 'director goodman', 'dr. daniel', 'professor goodman']: so you don't think we should stand up to tyrants?
['hodgins', 'jack hodgins', 'jack', 'dr. hodgins', 'dr hodgins', 'dr. jack', 'mr. hodgins', 'hodges', 'hodg', 'jack h', 'hodginz', 'dr hodges']: sure. [smirks] i've been waitin' for the press to do that for three years now.

['hodgins', 'jack hodgins', 'jack', 'dr. hodgins', 'dr hodgins', 'dr. jack', 'mr. hodgins', 'hodges', 'hodg', 'jack h', 'hodginz', 'dr hodges']: marshall could've had a change of heart. it's not like support for the war is increasing.

cpt. fuller: yes. a national guard unit can be difficult to lead. nothing against the guard, but usually they're inexperienced, shortchanged on equipment.
cpt. fuller: but kent's unit, they were one of the best i ever had.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: and devon marshall?
cpt. fuller: marshall was a good soldier. but after he came back, he seemed to turn against the military. saw us as the problem over there. you must've known men like that.

booth (offscreen): tougher than usual.
[cpt. fuller looks at booth. booth stares back knowingly. cpt. fuller looks away.]
cpt. fuller: we were on a patrol in mosul.
cpt (offscreen): intel reports indicated there were insurgents in this neighbourhood.
cpt. fuller: we were canvassing the area.
[camera whites out and fades back in to show a soldier sitting in the driver's side of a military vehicle.]
cpt. fuller (voiceover): private campbell, she stayed in the humvee as the unit headed towards a small house up the street.
[five soldiers climb out of the military humvee, armed and checking their equipment.]
cpt. fuller (voiceover): there were five of us -- kent, marshall, martin, lefferts, myself.
[they move in a line towards the house. cpt. fuller stops and gestures for two soldiers to go around.]
cpt. fuller: it was a small house -- two rooms. i looked through the slat and saw three insurgents in the back room, one a woman.
[camera shows fleeting images of a man with a gun slung on his shoulder, another man with a gun standing next to the woman.]
cpt. fuller: they men had ak-47s. i sent kent and lefferts to cover the back so no one could run.
[kent and lefferts quickly round the corner, gun ready. kent looks back and leffert nods tensely. cut back to cpt. fuller, marshall and martin at the front door.]
cpt. fuller: i was getting the others into position when one of the insurgents must've spotted kent.
[flash to kent peeking into the door and flash back to fuller's group.]
cpt. fuller: i heard the pop, pop, pop of the enemy ak-47.
[kent comes barging through the door, gun raised and firing into the room.
cpt. fuller: kent made entry to take them out before they could get to the rest of us. lefferts followed him in while we were kicking in the front door.
[lefferts fires at the insurgents, quickly shadowing kent.]
cpt. fuller: when we got to them, kent had already been kill taking out the insurgents.
[cpt. fuller, marshall and martin kick in the door and move quickly, making sure that other insurgents were not present. they stop at the entrance to the room; lefferts looks up as he applies pressure to kent's wounds.]
cpt. fuller: sight like that stays with you. two part-times like that, i guess it was too much.
[camera whites out and cuts back to present time.]
cpt. fuller: but whatever marshall was trying to do desecrating kent's grave, kent saved the unit. marshall can't take that away.

['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: [walks over to hodgins, but doesn't look at him] did you find anything in the wounds that might've changed the trajectory of the bullets?
['hodgins', 'jack hodgins', 'jack', 'dr. hodgins', 'dr hodgins', 'dr. jack', 'mr. hodgins', 'hodges', 'hodg', 'jack h', 'hodginz', 'dr hodges']: [looks discomfited] not yet. just residual sesquioxide, in silico accumulation. a little decayed organic matter. probably food that was on the floor. so--
['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: thank you. [turns to leave]
['hodgins', 'jack hodgins', 'jack', 'dr. hodgins', 'dr hodgins', 'dr. jack', 'mr. hodgins', 'hodges', 'hodg', 'jack h', 'hodginz', 'dr hodges']: look, angela. [she stops and turns back.] look, i run on sometimes, i know. i guess i think if i yell loud enough, maybe someone will listen.
['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: well you have to be careful people don't go deaf. [sighs] you know, what you did for booth before... showing him you understood, that was good. everyone hears something like that.
[angela gives him a small smile as she walks away. hodgins watches her before turning back, looking bashful, please and contemplative.]
[cut to: interrogation room. booth is sitting across from a woman. this is private campbell, the driver of the humvee that night in mosul.]
campbell: i joined the guard 'cause they helped pay for medical school. all my life i wanted to be a doctor. it's all i ever wanted. [looks rueful] i never thought i'd get sent overseas, much less iraq.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: your service record is exemplary.
campbell: i survived. that's my achievement.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: look, i'm sorry to do this, miss campbell. i'm just trying to reconstruct the night of the firefight.
campbell: [sighs, looks up and then back to booth] i was parked in the alley. the captain told me to stay in the humvee. women aren't supposed to engage in direct combat.
[camera flashes white and fades into the scene of cpt. fuller climbing out of the humvee, the other four following him.]
campbell (voiceover): he took the unit to the house. [the soldiers are advancing up the street carefully] the street was quiet. i was waiting. [cuts to campbell sitting alone in the driver's seat.] then i heard the pop, pop, pop of the ak-47. [cuts the interrogation room to booth, who stares at her intensely.] then kent and lefferts firing...the captain and the others breaking down the door. then everything stopped.
[quickly cuts to a lone soldier running.]
campbell (voiceover): it went quiet again. then the captain came back, told me kent had been hit. [camera shows cpt. fuller talking to campbell, no sound. campbell runs out of the car, carrying a medkit.] he knew i was a med student, so he sent me in while he radioed for a medevac. [cpt. fuller is rapidly talking into a radio.]
[campbell quickly walks in and kneels next to kent. lefferts is on his other side, his hands still on kent's chest.]
campbell (voiceover): as an intern, i've seen a lot of horrible things. [campbell listens for breathing, checks his pulse but finds nothing as she stares back up, looking bleak.] but when it's your friend... [quick cut back into the interrogation room] someone you serve with--
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: [quietly] yeah.
[another man is sitting in the chair. lefferts is wearing a suit, looking discomfited.]
lefferts: been in the guard for years. didn't think i'd ever get called up again. i mean, i'm 45. there's just not enough men for this mess.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: look, mr. lefferts, if we could just-- [booth pushes away from the wall and sits in the chair.]
[lefferts looks away for a long moment, seemingly trying to get his nerve. closes his eyes and starts to talk.]
lefferts: we were 22 hours into a 12-hour detail. you try that when it's 110 degrees out. [sighs] they called me dad 'cause i was the old guy. [cuts to cpt. fuller signalling lefferts and kent to go around back.] [voiceover] kent was a kid. captain sent us around back. i was supposed to look out for him. [kent moves in front of lefferts, alert, gun raised. lefferts scans around as they round the corner.] it got like i really was the damn kid's father.
lefferts: kent was gun, you know? [cuts back to the interrogation room] would've fought the whole damn war himself. heh. so he sees something move inside. something shines off the light. [the iraqi woman walks into the backroom.] a barrel, he says. and then we hear people moving around. somebody coming towards us from inside. [bright lights flash in the small window of the door.] then somebody fires.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: what did it sound like-- the shots? [looks at him intently]
lefferts: it was like a pop, pop, pop. [cut to kent kicking the door in, firing as a man moves into his line of sight.] [voiceover] then kent rushes in, sees the first guy, blows him away. he wasn't supposed to go in by himself. so i rush in. [lefferts moves in, firing his gun. the iraqi man jerks and falls to the ground.] i take out the last guy. and then it all stops. and when it does, kent is lying there. [lefferts gapes and then crouches next to kent's body.]
[cut back to the interrogation room. lefferts is looking horrified, reliving those moments.]
lefferts: i-i-i can't believe it! i'm-i'm-i'm staring down at kent, and-- [cut to cpt. fuller and the others coming into the back room] and then the others, they ask, "what happened, dad? dad, what happened?" [lefferts breathes hard, cut back into the interrogation room.]
lefferts: [moaning] and i'm-- and i'm staring down at kent like he really is my kid. i'm a lawyer! [sighs] a damn lawyer. i shouldn't have been there. *none* of us should've been there.
[booth continues to stare at him, a grim look on his face.]
[cut to: lab - platform. brennan is working with a piece of evidence under a microscope.]

"pop, pop, pop." it was rehearsed.
[brennan looks at him, curious.]
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: they're hiding something.

[pulls out a bullet from one of the entry wounds, squinting at it.] there's something devon knew about.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: and someone else didn't want to get out.
[brennan pulls out another bullet, studies it and places it in a tray.]
['zack', 'zach', 'zack addy', 'zach addy', 'dr. addy', 'dr addy', 'z. addy', 'zack a', 'zackk', 'zaky', 'dr. zack', 'doc addy']: that's all of them.

['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: [looks at the screen with the fatal bullets displayed] these rounds aren't from an ak-47. [gestures to the other tray] these are.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: well, they didn't kill him. circulation had stopped by the time these bullets hit.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: wait. the ones that kill him are from an m-14.

['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: [knowingly] friendly fire.

[brennan nods and looks down while booth looks aside, arms crossed.]
[cut to: washington, d.c. - streets. a quick look of the washington monument]

['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: devon wanted to tell the truth, but lefferts, he's got a succesful legal practice. too much to lose. lefferts kill devon. son of a--
[cut to: office. lefferts is dead, hanging lifelessly from the ceiling by the cord wrapped around his neck. he's still dressed in the shirt and tie he was wearing in the interrogation room. camera pans away to show local police and forensics people crowding by the door.]

cpt. fuller: [cuts her off] you're good at your job, dr. brennan, but you don't know the first thing about combat. we were taking fire. one of my men was kill. the area wasn't secured. do you think i'm counting bullets and drawing pictures?
cpt. fuller: [to booth] you've been through it. does it ever go the way you want it to? is it ever the way it should be in combat?

hank: [leans in closer] you never talked to anybody about it? [booth shakes his head] you've got to. how about your girlfriend? that doctor?
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: nah. no, she's-- you know. she's just my partner. [quickly] you know, look, i got work. i should go.

[computer beeps] okay, single out the ones that came from lefferts' weapon. this is hard for booth. he's idealistic.
['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: well, it's nice to know somebody that wants to keep honor and responsibility alive.

[looks down at the files] okay, it says insurgent "a" opened fire when he saw kent and kent took him out. let's see "a" again.
[photo changes to the iraqi man with his hands held out, gun in his lap.]
['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: you're just doing your job. he knows that.

['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: what are you looking for?

['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: what do you mean?

[flips the page] i'm not the one who's disillusioning him. it's my findings. but when i look at him, i-- [sighs] i don't know what else i can do.
['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: i do.

['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: [huffs] as a friend, brennan.

['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: i'm not talking about that. i'm-- i'm talking about being there for him. knowing when a simple touch is enough.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: maybe i can write him a note. i can be very articulate on paper. [angela concedes defeat] zoom in. okay, magnify the blood smear.
[computer zooms in on the blood smeared on the carpet.]
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: i mean, you can see by the smear he was moved, turned, that gun placed next to him. okay, show me "c." [this photo shows kent lying in the foreground, dead. behind him lies a woman, lying on her side.]
['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: okay, this is the third insurgent woman, about 40, holding the unexploded grenade in her hand.

['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: wait, she's lying on a dinner plate.

['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: and a grenade? [looks skeptical]
[booth walks into the office.]
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: found anything yet?

[turns to face him] none of these people were armed when kent went in there. all of the weapon were plated on them after they died. fuller's unit kill an unarmed family.
[booth and angela are stunned.]
[fade out]
[fade in: lab - angela's office, direct continuation from the previous scene.]
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: kent shot unarmed people?
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: they look like a family.
['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: about to sit down to dinner.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: were there any other questionable operations with this unit?
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: none. they served another six months without incident.
['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: how could something like this have happened?
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: woman could've heard 'em. she was on her way to the backdoor. kent probably thought the spoon was a weapon.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: a spoon?

[flash to the serving spoon held in the woman's hand.] he's inexperienced. he's scared out of his mind. you only have an instant to make a choice. kent probably thought he was being attacked so he burst through the door.
[flash to kent bursting into the house.]
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: from the spray pattern, he was shooting as he entered. [cut to the muzzle of kent's gun flashing, woman and man falling to the ground, shot.] he must've kill the woman first, the others as they rushed to the woman to help.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: he probably thought they were attacking too. lefferts hears all the firing. he goes in. [cut to lefferts coming through the door, gun raised.] kent turns. weapon's still pointed. [cut to kent turning, gun at the ready. lefferts fires. kent goes down.] lefferts shoot, kill kent. it all happens in seconds.
['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: but if kent turned to face him--
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: it doesn't matter. i mean, after all the shooting all lefferts sees is a weapon pointing right at him. he just reacted.
['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: god.

['angela', 'angela montenegro', 'ms. montenegro', 'ms montenegro', 'ang', 'ange', 'an', 'a.montenegro', 'angella', 'angla', 'angelina', 'miss montenegro', 'angela m', 'dr. angela']: so this was more than a friendly fire incident.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: [nodding] a hell of a lot more.

[grabs cpt. fuller and slams him against the cabinet] you covered up the whole thing!
cpt. fuller: stand down, agent booth!
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: they were innocent!
cpt. fuller: i don't know what you've heard, but my report clearly states--
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: we've taken your report apart! we have the *facts*, captain! your squad blew away a family of innocents!
cpt. fuller: kent! kent did! [booth releases him] a kid so green he never should have been there in the first place. do you know what that town was like? our guys were being blown up by i.e.d.'s every day while we were trying to build hospitals and schools. a mistake was made. no one likes it. but you know what happens. if it got out what we did that neighbourhood, the whole damn city would've exploded.
cpt. fuller: what would you have done? would you have let the city burn? this can't come out, agent booth. don't make this any harder with an ugly story like this.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: i don't know what you're fighting for, fuller, but it sure as hell wasn't my country. [pulls out handcuffs] we'll start with obstruction of justice.
cpt. fuller: [leers] you have no jurisdiction on this base.
man (offscreen): but we do, captain, and we're cooperating fully with agent booth. you will not disgrace us, captain. you will be held accountable.
[booth turns cpt. fuller around and cuffs him harshly.]
[cut to: jeffersonian institution - exterior.]

['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: zack found some discoloration on devon's vertebrae. it was caused by residue from pethidine, an opiate affectionately known as demerol.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: someone jabbed a syringe into his neck, creating the indentation in the bone. he would've been unconscious in seconds. that's why the instrument could've been placed in his ear without a struggle.
['zack', 'zach', 'zack addy', 'zach addy', 'dr. addy', 'dr addy', 'z. addy', 'zack a', 'zackk', 'zaky', 'dr. zack', 'doc addy']: it was a nine-inch surgical curette like this. [holds up the item.]
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: so we're looking for someone with access to surgical tools and prescription drugs.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: someone the army sent to medical school.
[cut to: clinic - interior. pvt. campbell places a band-aid on a young girl's cut on her shoulder.]
campbell: all done.
[booth, brennan and army soldiers walk in. campbell looks up and is not surprised, but resigned. booth and brennan look expectant. campbell looks down, nods to herself and looks back up.]
campbell: he was gonna tell. i-- it's like the war was still going on. i was just trying to survive.
[cut to: arlington national cemetary - grounds.]

[a line of soldiers holding ceremonial gun and dressed in their formal gear march past karen and jimmy martin, regina and kiara marshall, col. shore, all standing by devon marshall's casket.]
[the marshalls walk towards the gathered mourners, booth and brennan standing in the front row.]
regina marshall: my boy was just trying to do the right thing. thank you for letting people see that.

[they leave, leaving brennan and booth alone. they meet with the kent family, and tina kent embraces regina marshall, sharing their mutual loss.]
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: i would never have expected to see that.

[booth sits] it's not. i have to be uh, honest about myself. [brennan sits next to him] i-- i have to be able to tell someone.
['brennan', 'dr. brennan', 'dr brennan', 'temperance', 'temperance brennan', 'dr. temperance', 'dr temperance', 'dr. temperance brennan', 'dr temperance brennan', 'bones', 'temp', 'dr bones', 'ms. brennan', 'ms brennan', 'brnnan', 'brannan', 'dr.brennan', 'dr.brenan']: you will in time, booth. you will.

['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: i was the sniper sent in to stop him. he was set to leave in a couple hours. it was his son's-- son's birthday. a little boy maybe about six or seven. i can still hear the music from the party, you know? that song just playing in my head. nobody knew where the shot came from, but, you know, they knew why it came.
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: they said i saved over a hundred people. but, you know, that little boy who didn't know who his father was, who-- who just loved him... he saw him die, fall to the ground right in front of him. that little boy all covered in his daddy's blood was changed forever. [sighs] it's never just-- it's never just the one person who dies, bones. never. never.
[brennan places a hand on his forearm, silent. booth sniffles, and places his hand atop hers, grateful.]
['booth', 'agent booth', 'special agent booth', 'special agent seeley booth', 'seeley', 'seeley booth', 'mr. booth', 'mr booth', 'officer booth', 'boothy', 'boothie', 'bth', 'bohth', 'boof', 'dr. booth']: you know, we all die a little bit, bones. with each shot, we all die a little bit.
