TEASER
(Open: outside of the CHECKER BOX, a karaoke bar. People are entering. Someone inside the bar is singing "Corner of the Sky" from the musical Pippin)
Voice: "Gotta find my corner..."
(Cut to: inside the bar. It is crowded. We can now see KEVIN singing on stage with someone playing the piano)
KEVIN: (con'd) "...of the sky!"
(Cut to: crowd applauding the performance. We see JERRY LINCOLN stand up from a table to the side of the bar, and begin to walk towards the stage. We also see a sh*t of MITCH sitting in the back of the bar, with a pad and pen - clearly a talent scout. KEVIN walks offstage as LINCOLN approaches)
LINCOLN: Thanks Kevin. Another great performance! But Open Mic Night is just beginning. So let's hear it for the beautiful - and persistent - Emma Von Helberg!
(Crowd claps with some amusement. We see a sh*t of TOMMY SOUR, looking amused)
(Piano begins playing "Slave 4 U" by Britney Spears. EMMA, standing on stage, badly mimics the style of Spears in her rendition of the song)
EMMA: (singing badly) "Get it, get it, get it, get it, ohhhhh! I'm a slaaave for you. I cannot hold it, I cannot control it, I'm a...slaaave for you."
(We are spared the rest of EMMA's performance as the camera flashes through a series of performers of varying k*ll and quality)
SPRINGSTEEN WANNABE: "But I'll return so don't you worry..." ("Hearts of Stone")
DOLLY PARTON WANNABE: "Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'...barely, gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'!" ("9 to 5")
LOUNGE-LIZARD WANNABE: "If we could talk to the animals, kooky, learn their languages. Maybe take an animal degree!" ("Talk to the Animals" by Leslie Bricusse)
(The singing montage stops on TOMMY, now up on stage, performing a rendition of "Far Away" by Nickelback. He is significantly more k*ll than the performers that we have seen thus far)
TOMMY: "This time, this place, misused, mistakes..."
(The camera cuts briefly to CHRIS CALABASA sitting in the audience, looking disgruntled. He appears jealous of TOMMY's k*ll)
TOMMY: (con'd) "...too long, too late, who was I to make you wait?"
(We see MITCH, the talent scout again, this time taking notes)
TOMMY: (con'd) "...just one chance, just one breath, just in case there's just one left."Cause you know, you know, you know! That I love you..."
(The camera cuts to HELEN, sitting in the front row. She giggles, and turns away, flattered and embarrassed that TOMMY seems to be singing to her. DAX, who is sitting beside her, is obviously not as pleased as she is)
TOMMY: (con'd) "...I loved you all along. And I miss you. Been far away for far too long..."
(We see a sh*t of LINCOLN. He nods, impressed)
TOMMY: (con'd) "...I keep dreaming, you'll be with me and you'll never go! Stop breathing if I don't see you anymore!"
(The song ends, and the crowd cheers, obviously impressed by the k*ll performer. LINCOLN stands and approaches the stage)
LINCOLN: Okay up next another Checker Box regular - the smooth and smoky voice of Chris Calabasa!
(CHRIS stands and approaches the stage. He passes TOMMY on the way by)
CHRIS: (angrily) Could have left that song in the shower.
TOMMY: Couldn't listen to you butcher it again.
(TOMMY shoulders CHRIS out of the way, and walks to his seat. CHRIS moves up to the stage, to crowd murmurs. Someone calls out, "All right Chris!")
CHRIS: (to PIANO PLAYER) Bastard took my tune. Play Piano Man.
PIANO PLAYER: (condescendingly) That's original.
(The piano starts up ("Piano Man" by Billy Joel). The camera pans the audience. TOMMY smiles at CHRIS's choice of song - it's probably not going to impress anyone. CHRIS seems to know it too)
CHRIS: "It's nine o'clock on a Saturday...the regular crowd shuffles in..."
(In the audience, TOMMY and MITCH exchange a glance. MITCH puts the cap on his pen - no need to take notes for this song - and gives TOMMY a gesture indicating "Good job". TOMMY grins proudly)
CHRIS: "...there's an old man sitting next to me, making love to his tonic and gin..."
(HELEN from earlier rolls her eyes at DAX, and goes to depart. She passes by TOMMY's table and they smile at each other. She leans over and whispers something in his ear before leaving)
CHRIS: "...sing us a song you're the piano man. Sing us a song tonight. Well we're all in the mood for a melody..."
(TOMMY looks anxiously down at his watch. The camera fades from the image of the bar to a new location. Same watch, but now surrounded by sticks and leaves, and on an arm that is clearly dead. A flashlight crosses it)
BRENNAN: Every bone appears to be broken.
(The camera slowly rises, showing farm land. BRENNAN, CAM and BOOTH are standing on a rural road, looking over the body with flashlights. BOOTH sneezes)
CAM: Bless you.
BOOTH: Ugh. Thank you.
BRENNAN: Pelvic fragment suggests it's a male...
(BOOTH sneezes again. CAM looks at him)
CAM: Are you okay?
BOOTH: Thank you, fine. Just...
BRENNAN: Particles from the cut grass are causing his mast cells to release inflammatory mediators.
BOOTH: It's just allergies Bones.
BRENNAN: I know. That's what I said.
CAM: (looking at the body) Given the degree of decomp he's been dead a couple of weeks.
BOOTH: Body dump?
CAM: Lividity's indeterminate.
BOOTH: Oh. (Sneezes again)
BRENNAN: How does a former sn*per have a grass allergy? I mean, wouldn't a sneeze give away your position?
BOOTH: Bones, okay, I worked in the desert. Sand, no grass.
(A man approaches from his mower. He is clearly the one who found the body)
DRIVER: It was the crunching that got my attention.
BOOTH: Well, did you see the body before it crunched?
DRIVER: It's not my fault! You know, Johnson grass is eight feet high and dense. It's like driving in the dark!
BOOTH: Wow, you must have been driving fast.
DRIVER: ...Well, I had an internet date. I wanted to get home to shower. (Realizes) She's probably still waiting for me at the Falafel place.
(BOOTH sneezes again)
DRIVER: You know, Johnson grass lets off a ton of pollen man. Your eyes could swell up. If your throat closes-
BOOTH: Allergies. Okay? I'm fine.
BRENNAN: (to DRIVER) You didn't by any chance see a head, did you?
(DRIVER bites hip lip, looks around uncomfortably)
BOOTH: The head's missing?
BRENNAN: I don't see it, or any skull fragments.
DRIVER: (sheepishly) Sorry.
CAM: Well, I've got some brain matter here, so he had to have a head at some point.
(BRENNAN moves towards the truck, shines her flashlight under the grill. A skull stares back at her.)
BRENNAN: Found it!
DRIVER: (chuckling) My date's not gonna believe this.
BRENNAN: The blade must have severed just below the C5 vertebra. And the force of the impact propelled the head into the grill.
BOOTH: So, presumably, he was k*ll, decapitated, and mulched. (Exhales) Wow. Could it get any worse for this guy?
(Ironically, the right eyeball falls out of its socket, still connected to the skull. Small ants can be seen crawling over the surrounding tissue)
ACT 1
(Open: Medico-Legal-Lab - Cam's Office. ZACK, CAM and ANGELA are examining the body)
ZACK: The bones are dense with a high degree of robusticity.
CAM: Well that's consistent with his musculature. The guy was built! (Pause) He was probably an athlete. I bet he was hot.
ANGELA: Yeah, well, now he's really not.
CAM: I think he had a cold.
ANGELA: Looks like it was a pretty bad one.
CAM: I found traces of tea and honey in his stomach and the remains of a throat lozenge.
(HODGINS enters)
HODGINS: (as he sees the body) Oh wow. (He holds up an evidence bag) v*ctim's watch. Totally cool. Measures heart rate, calories b*rned, speed, distance-
CAM: Jock! I rest my case.
ANGELA: It's bad enough going to the gym without getting yelled at by a watch.
ZACK: My regimen is easily completed in my apartment. Treadmill for thirty minutes, a hundred sit ups, push ups, and leg lifts, and twenty minutes of free weights.
(CAM is surprised, but tries to hide it)
ZACK: (to CAM) I'm deceptively strong.
CAM: (nods) I'm deceived!
ANGELA: Hey, odontology got a match.
(Camera cuts briefly to computer, where an image of TOMMY appears)
ANGELA: Tommy Sour. He was reported missing two weeks ago.
(Cut to: Tommy Sour and Adam Matthew's shared apartment. BOOTH and BRENNAN are knocking on one of two doors. BOOTH is growing impatient)
BOOTH: (listening at the door) I hear someone in there.
BRENNAN: (eagerly) Hey! Break down the door!
BOOTH: It hurts my shoulder when I break down the door.
(Sounds of an alarm clock going off in the other apartment. BOOTH knocks again)
BOOTH: What is that annoying noise? (He goes towards the other door)
(BRENNAN turns the knob on the first door and pushes it open)
BOOTH: (stopping her) You don't just walk in and-
MATTHEWS: (as he approaches the now open door) Sorry, I had my earplugs in. Can I help you with something?
BOOTH: (flashing his badge) FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth, this here is Dr. Temperance Brennan from the Jeffersonian. You reported Tommy Sour missing?
MATTHEWS: Yeah, couple weeks ago. He lives in the unit next door.
BOOTH: Can we come in?
(Cut to: inside of apartment. There are many paintings and sculptures strewn around the room. BRENNAN is admiring them)
MATTHEWS: Excuse the mess, I've got a show in a month.
BRENNAN: (nodding to a painting) You're influenced by the New York Expressionists?
(Sounds of alarm clock going off next door)
MATTHEWS: Oh, don't even look at that. That is crap. (Listening) There it goes again! I can't focus. That alarm has been beeping every two minutes since Tommy went missing.
BOOTH: Yeah, you know what? That is annoying.
MATTHEWS: Yeah, that's why I've got the earplugs. When the cops first showed up, I asked them to unplug it. They didn't. Maybe you guys could!
BOOTH: Mr. Matthews, Tommy Sour is dead.
MATTHEWS: ...Oh god.
BOOTH: Before he went missing, was there anything unusual about his behaviour?
MATTHEWS: Well, I didn't know him all that well.
BRENNAN: You reported him missing.
MATTHEWS: Yeah well his mail started piling up on his front door and then that damn alarm clock keeps driving me crazy.
BRENNAN: (gesturing to another piece of art) This sculpture is very impressive.
MATTHEWS: Yeah, it's from my "pre-alarm-clock" period.
BOOTH: What about strangers, any new faces around here?
MATTHEWS: Oh wait, uh, yeah. Fat Pam?
BRENNAN: Excuse me?
MATTHEWS: Fat Pam? She was one of Tommy's clients.
BOOTH: I thought you didn't know him that well.
MATTHEWS: Well, he was my neighbour. We took the garbage out, we saw each other, we talk a little bit, you know what it's like. Anyway, Tommy was Fat Pam's trainer at... Valera Wellness.
BRENNAN: Must you call her 'Fat Pam'?
MATTHEWS: That's what he called her! Hey, it's not like Tommy was the nicest guy who ever lived. She wasn't really all that fat either.
BRENNAN: You mean overweight. Fat is a deposit found underneath the skin. It consists of lipids-
MATTHEWS: Okay. Sure. Uh, Pam just wasn't one of those fitness robots that Tommy would spend his time with. She started following Tommy home, from the gym. She'd sit out on the curb and watch his place. And then, about a month ago, she showed up, middle of the night... started banging on his door.
BOOTH: Oh, was she angry?
MATTHEWS: ...She was wearing a teddy and heels, so I'm thinking anger wasn't her prime emotion.
BRENNAN: (triumphantly) You're implying that she was sexually stimulated.
(MATTHEWS awkwardly confirms BRENNAN's statement)
BOOTH: So were they um... (claps his hands a bit) you know... did they (continues clapping, growing more insistent).
BRENNAN: Did they have sexual intercourse?
MATTHEWS: Well, if they did, it was through a locked door.
BRENNAN: So, no?
BOOTH: (claps again) Very good Bones, okay let's go.
BRENNAN: Why are you clapping?
BOOTH: Because I am. (To Matthews) Thank you for your help.
MATTHEWS: (as they leave) Hey, uh, maybe you could turn the alarm off? Or just, sh**t it?!
(Cut to: Medico-Legal-Lab - Zack's office. ZACK and CAM are determining cause of death. ZACK is examining a small bone)
ZACK: C5, adjacent to the hyoid, seems to be shaved on its front.
CAM: Shaved?
ZACK: Yes, like with a cheese slicer.
CAM: Must mean someone slit his throat.
ZACK: This doesn't look like it was caused by a kn*fe. There are no serrations. Even microscopic.
CAM: What then?
ZACK: ...A cheese slicer seems illogical under the circumstances. I'll start looking for alternatives.
(Cut to: Valera Wellness Gym. We see several people working on various exercise equipment. BOOTH and BRENNAN walk through the gym looking for the manager)
BOOTH: Look, these people are just trying to get healthy Bones. That's all.
BRENNAN: There is a fine line between 'health' and 'vanity'.
(BOOTH's attention is caught by an attractive woman working out on one of the machines. He is distracted.)
BOOTH: ...Huh?
BRENNAN: Well, this obsession with physical perfection clouds a society's moral vision. (She notices BOOTH's distraction, and swats him teasingly) You are ogling that woman!
BOOTH: What? No, I'm not, I'm just-
BRENNAN: Yes you are!
BOOTH: I, I, I'm just... um, admiring her routine.
(DR. JASON BERGMAN - the manager - approaches, cutting off the argument)
DR. JASON: I am the Wellness Centre's manager, Dr. Jason. I understand you're with the FBI.
BOOTH: I'm Special Agent Seeley Booth, this here's Dr. Temperance Brennan. We're here about Thomas Sour.
DR. JASON: He in trouble?
BOOTH: He's dead.
DR. JASON: That explains why he's not returning my calls.
BOOTH: You don't seem too upset about that.
DR. JASON: Tommy was my most popular trainer. Since he disappeared, I've had to deal with a lot of angry clients. You're with the FBI, that mean Tommy was m*rder?
BOOTH: You wouldn't happen to know a woman, a client of his, Pam? (no reaction from Dr. Jason) Some people refer to her as 'Fat Pam'?
DR. JASON: (recognition) I know who you mean. Pam Nunan. She booked two hour sessions. Paid cash. Perfect client. Until...
BRENNAN: Until?
DR. JASON: Until she fell in love with Tommy. Started to freak him out.
BRENNAN: How so?
DR. JASON: She was too handsy. She'd rub up against him. Even invited him on a Caribbean cruise.
BOOTH: Would you happen to have Ms. Nunan's address?
DR. JASON: Sure.
(DR. JASON walks away - presumably in the direction of his office. As he goes, BOOTH sees the same woman, now stretching after her workout. He becomes distracted again. BRENNAN notices, and swats him again)
BRENNAN: Booth!
BOOTH: Yeah?
BRENNAN: That's not helping the investigation.
(BOOTH shrugs)
(Cut to: FBI - Booth's office. BRENNAN and BOOTH are meeting with PAM NUNAN. She has brought with her a photo album, full of images of TOMMY)
PAM: He's such a cutie, isn't he? Tommy is such a wonderful person. Big heart, and so devoted.
BRENNAN: You brought a photo album?
PAM: You said you wanted to talk about Tommy. I figured you'd like to see pictures.
BOOTH: Those pictures are... (he holds out his hands for the album. PAM passes it to him) They are taken from quite a distance, Pam.
PAM: He's so shy. It's one of the things I love about him.
BRENNAN: We understand that Tommy was your personal trainer?
PAM: Oh, he was so much more than that. Before I met Tommy, I was so down on myself. But Tommy... he's such a sweetheart.
BRENNAN: Does Tommy share your affection?
PAM: Why do you ask it like that? (to BOOTH) Because I don't look like a scarecrow? Like her?
BRENNAN: Hey! What - what are you coming after me for? (to BOOTH) D-do I look like a scarecrow?
BOOTH: Well, you... (to PAM) I think you look good.
(BRENNAN is put out)
PAM: Thank you. Like Tommy, you see me for who I really am. Not... scrawny.
(PAM glares pointedly at BRENNAN)
BRENNAN: What - I am not scrawny. My body mass index is well within the normal limits-
BOOTH: Can we talk about Tommy please?
PAM: If he didn't love me, why would he want to marry me?
BOOTH: Marry you? He was going to marry you?
PAM: Tommy's my life. And I'm his. Whatever you think he's done, I know he didn't do it.
BRENNAN: We're not worried about what he did. It's what you might have done.
(PAM looks between BRENNAN and BOOTH in confusion)
BOOTH: Tommy is dead.
ACT 2
(Cut to: FBI - Interrogation Room. BRENNAN and SWEETS are standing outside the room, observing PAM through the glass. She is eating a snack inside the interrogation room.)
SWEETS: She has body image issues, which are not congruent with her actual appearance. She's someone who's slightly large, who believes she's a very large woman, who can convince people she's only slightly large. And the way people treat her convinces her that she's right.
BRENNAN: That's interesting.
SWEETS: See, you're only pretending that's interesting. It means very little to you.
BRENNAN: That's true.
SWEETS: You have an irrational prejudice against psychology, probably because of emotions that are too complicated for you to deal with. And I poke, and I prod at them (he pokes BRENNAN. She pulls away in annoyance) which makes them real. And painful.
BRENNAN: And yet I feel no pain. Just a sort of... disinterest. So why don't you take you powers of observation... (she gestures towards PAM) and focus them on her.
(SWEETS and BRENNAN exchange a look)
SWEETS: All right. (He looks at PAM) She's sorting her trail mix.
BRENNAN: That means something?
SWEETS: She's nervous. She's trying to control a situation that's out of her control.
BRENNAN: Or she's just bored. She's been waiting almost an hour.
(Cut to: BOOTH enters the interrogation room. PAM looks up)
BOOTH: Sorry to have kept you waiting.
PAM: I didn't k*ll Tommy. I loved him.
(BOOTH approaches the desk, and looks down at PAM's snack, half sorted into neat little piles)
BOOTH: What's this?
PAM: I got bored.
(Cut briefly to: BRENNAN sh**ting SWEETS a triumphant look, and him looking away resignedly)
PAM: I've been waiting here over an hour.
BOOTH: I believe that you loved Tommy.
PAM: Thank you Agent Booth. I did.
BOOTH: But I don't believe that he loved you back.
PAM: ...Because I'm not anorexic?
BOOTH: Ms. Nunan...
PAM: Call me Pam.
BOOTH: Pam. You were stalking him. And he was avoiding you.
PAM: If he didn't love me, why would he give me this for Christmas? (She pulls up her sleeve and shows BOOTH a bracelet on her wrist. She holds up a few of the charms) P-A-M. You know what that spells?
BOOTH: Pam.
PAM: That's right.
BOOTH: What did you, um, give him, before he gave you that bracelet?
(Cut to: SWEETS and BRENNAN observing)
SWEETS: Ahh. Excellent question.
(BRENNAN looks at him in annoyance)
PAM: Why does that matter?
BOOTH: Just curious.
(Cut to: PAM and BOOTH in the interrogation room)
PAM: A one thousand dollar gift certificate to The Music Centre. He loved music.
BOOTH: A thousand dollars. Wow. That's generous.
(Cut to: SWEETS and BRENNAN observing)
SWEETS: A way to obligate him. Try and enforce an emotional connection. It's extremely passive-aggressive.
BRENNAN: So do you think she k*ll him?
SWEETS: Well, there's no question that she's deluded. I mean, if she truly believed that he was going to marry her, she was setting herself up for a tragic ending.
BRENNAN: Tragic?
SWEETS: Well, one way to ensure that he didn't leave her...
BRENNAN: Would be to k*ll him.
(SWEETS confirms BRENNAN's assumption)
(Cut to: BOOTH and PAM in the interrogation room)
PAM: Tommy had a beautiful voice. He dreamed of being a professional singer and I wanted to support him. I did everything for him. He was mine. Tommy was mine, no matter what anyone thought. When did you find him?
BOOTH: Last night. He had been dead for two weeks.
PAM: I've been in Florida. Left last month. Just got back two days ago. I was with Mommy and Daddy planning the wedding.
(Cut briefly to: SWEETS and BRENNAN's nervous reactions)
BOOTH: The wedding with Tommy.
PAM: Of course silly.
(BOOTH nervously pulls a pad of paper and pen out of his jacket pocket)
BOOTH: I'm just going to need you to write down your parents' number in Florida so I can confirm your whereabouts.
(PAM writes down the number, and passes BOOTH the pad. BOOTH takes it, and stands up to leave)
BOOTH: Thanks.
PAM: (tearing up) Who's going to love me now?
BOOTH: I'm sorry.
(BOOTH slowly reaches out a hand to PAM, placing it carefully on her shoulder)
(Cut to: SWEETS and BRENNAN observing)
SWEET: No no no don't touch her-
BRENNAN: Why?
(Cut to: PAM, smiling in an entirely disconcerting way in the direction of the mirror as BOOTH removes his hand from her shoulder)
PAM: Thank you Agent Booth.
(Cut to: SWEETS and BRENNAN observing. SWEETS gestures in PAM's direction, indicating that whatever he was trying to prevent from happening has happened)
(Cut to: FBI - Booth's office. BOOTH is sitting behind his desk speaking to someone on the phone. BRENNAN and SWEETS enter]
SWEETS: The pathology is clear. She's possessive and amoral.
(BOOTH makes a sound and gesture to indicate that SWEETS should not speak so loudly)
SWEETS: (quieter) Her emotional connections are forged through manipulation and delusion. Once a connection that tenuous breaks-
BRENNAN: So she k*ll Tommy Sour?
SWEETS: I can't say that, of course, but she is a dangerous person.
BOOTH: (still on phone) Thank you. (He hangs up) Well, her story checks out. She was in Florida when he was k*ll. Her parents are devastated that their future son-in-law - who they never met - will no longer be her love-monkey.
BRENNAN: Well, Dr. Sweets still thinks that she's the k*ll.
SWEETS: Dangerous. I think she's dangerous.
BOOTH: I agree.
SWEETS: Thank you Agent Booth.
(BOOTH stands up from his desk and begins to walk around it towards SWEETS)
BOOTH: All those gifts, and taking pictures from a distance, and showing up in the middle of the night in a nighty, it's all very "dangerous".
SWEETS: (clueing in) Mocking will not change my opinion. I've been mocked many many times before...
(BOOTH and BRENNAN exchange a glance)
SWEETS: That... came out wrong.
(BOOTH begins to push SWEETS towards the door)
BOOTH: Yeah, that's great Sweets, appreciate your help, but you know what? She has an alibi. See ya.
(SWEETS reaches out to stop the door before it closes behind him)
SWEETS: Well, just be cautious of her. Okay? She's not stable.
BOOTH: Great, thank you.
(BOOTH tries to push the door closed - SWEETS stops it again)
SWEETS: Oh, and remember. Our session on Tuesday's at 4? Trust exercises? Be there?
(He departs)
BOOTH: Ha-ha. See ya.
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Cam's office. CAM is dumping some questionable substances into a container. BRENNAN walks in)
BRENNAN: I got your page.
CAM: Vic's tox report just came back. There were trace amounts of THC in his bloodstream.
(CAM walks from behind the desk, over to a large view screen)
BRENNAN: ...That's why you paged me? Because our v*ctim smoked marijuana?
CAM: No. Check out the monitor.
BRENNAN: His bl*od was infected with a bacterium.
CAM: E. coli. And given the concentration in his bl*od, I'd say the infection occurred within hours of his death.
BRENNAN: Well what was the source?
CAM: I'm getting there. The CDC tracks all E. coli outbreaks. And apparently the last E. coli ground zero was in Virginia at the Checker Box restaurant in Alexandria. The culprit? Tainted raw honey. The same kind I found in Tommy Sour's stomach.
(Cut to: Checker Box restaurant. KEVIN from the first night is singing again - the same song: "Corner of the Sky" from the musical Pippin)
KEVIN: "So many men seem destined to settle for something small..."
(Cut to: BOOTH, sitting in the audience, clearly suffering. BRENNAN enters from a door behind him and begins walking towards his table)
KEVIN: (con'd) "...But I won't rest until I know I'll have it all!"
BOOTH: (over KEVIN's singing, as BRENNAN approaches) Finally. I mean, one more show tune and I was going to start sh**ting.
BRENNAN: (about KEVIN) He has excellent projection. I heard him while I was parking.
BOOTH: Yeah, okay, I talked to some of the patrons here. Open Mic Night is every Monday and Tuesday.
(Cut to: HELEN and DAX, sitting in the front row again. They turn around in their seats and signal BOOTH to be quiet.)
(Cut back to: BOOTH, chuckling)
BOOTH: Actually, some of these people think that this stuff is good.
BRENNAN: What's Open Mic Night?
BOOTH: It's, uh, you know, Cabaret meets Karaoke. Oh, singers, that want to get discovered.
(Cut to: HELEN)
HELEN: Will you please be quiet?
(Cut back to: BRENNAN and BOOTH)
BRENNAN: Based on the E. coli in Tommy's bl*od, he definitely was here shortly before he was k*ll.
BOOTH: Pammy said he was musical.
(Cut briefly to: KEVIN, who is still on stage singing)
KEVIN: (con'd) "...find my cornerrrrr!"
BRENNAN: This guy is not bad!
BOOTH: You're kidding me.
BRENNAN: No, I love his enthusiasm.
(Cut to: DAX, still annoyed)
DAX: Dude, do I need to get the manager?
BOOTH: Dude, actually, you know what? That would be great. Why don't you... (he pulls his badge out of his pocket) point him out to us?
(DAX glares briefly, and then points.)
(Cut to: LINCOLN sitting at his usual table, looking uncomfortable)
(KEVIN finishes his song. The crowd applauds appreciatively, including BRENNAN. BOOTH remains annoyed)
(Cut to: LINCOLN, onstage)
LINCOLN: Up next, the smooth and smoky, Chris Calabasa!
(Cut to: CHRIS, who comes up from behind BRENNAN and BOOTH moving towards the stage. The piano begins playing "Far Away" by Nickelback. BOOTH leans over in his seat to get LINCOLN's attention)
BOOTH: Excuse me.
(LINCOLN walks over, looking uncomfortable)
BOOTH: (showing his badge) Agent Booth, FBI-
LINCOLN: Oh come on. I told you guys everything I know. I bought the raw honey from a company out of Maryland, I gave the CDC guy the Bill of Sale and the remaining honey. What else you want from me?
BRENNAN: No, we're not here about the E. coli. We need to speak with you about Tommy Sour.
BOOTH: We believe he was m*rder.
LINCOLN: m*rder?
BRENNAN: Were you friends?
LINCOLN: Well he, he was good for business. Talented. Showed up at every Open Mic Night since day one. When I didn't see him around I figured he got a... paying gig, you know?
BOOTH: Anything unusual about his final performance?
LINCOLN: No, everybody loved him, like always.
BOOTH: Everybody thinks they're the next Kelly Clarkson.
(BRENNAN, who has been watching CHRIS, turns back to the conversation at this comment)
LINCOLN: Yeah, you got that right.
BRENNAN: Who's Kelly Clarkson?
BOOTH: American Idol..."Because of You"...
BRENNAN: Because of me?
BOOTH: Never mind. Just... stay here, okay? Not up there (he gestures to the stage before turning back to LINCOLN). So, did he have any enemies?
LINCOLN: Yeah. You're listening to him right now.
(Cut briefly to: CHRIS onstage, singing)
LINCOLN: (con'd) There was a talent scout here that night. Tommy stole his song. Chris had to default to "Piano Man".
BOOTH: Oooh. That hurts.
LINCOLN: When Chris finished singing, he pulled Tommy aside and they started shoving each other. I told them to take it outside. They disappeared into the parking lot.
BOOTH: Then what?
LINCOLN: I don't know. I never saw Tommy again.
(CHRIS finishes his song to audience applause.)
(Cut to: BOOTH and BRENNAN in the audience, listening to the LOUNGE-LIZARD WANNABE and talking to CHRIS)
CHRIS: Tommy Sour was a jerk. He'd fill the joint with his Fitness groupies, who'd hoot and holler even when he sang off-key, and then they'd talk through the other acts. You know what that does to a singer's self-esteem?
BRENNAN: I would imagine it would be quite disheartening, given your need for acclaim.
(CHRIS is taken off guard. He doesn't understand what BRENNAN is saying)
BOOTH: Bones...
BRENNAN: What? It's a primal human need. The foundation for royalty...
BOOTH: Okay, you know what? You're just going to confuse him. (to CHRIS) Go on.
CHRIS: Tommy thought he was going to make it big. He showed me a cheque he wrote to himself for a million bucks - said he'd be cashing it by Christmas.
BOOTH: Well, was he any good?
CHRIS: (laughs) Last week, he had some dude videotape his set. It's up on his MySpace, you can check it out for yourself.
(BRENNAN is watching the LOUNGE-LIZARD WANNABE's act. She smiles)
BRENNAN: This guy is good! Ha-ha.
BOOTH: Ha-ha. Thank you Paula. Can you just focus here? (to CHRIS) So the night Tommy was k*ll, the two of you got into an argument over a song?
CHRIS: Not just "a" song - MY song. Far Away by Nickelback. Tommy knew that I was saving that for Scout Night.
BOOTH: Did it make you a little angry?
CHRIS: I didn't k*ll the guy. We went outside, I vented, and he took off.
BOOTH: That was it. You just said, 'Goodbye, see you later'?
CHRIS: I came back inside. I wanted to introduce myself to the Talent Scout. (He gestures over to the side of the room) He's back again, you can ask him yourself.
(Cut briefly to: MITCH from earlier, writing in his notebook)
BOOTH: Hey, I think I will.
(BOOTH gets up from the table)
BOOTH: (to BRENNAN) Stay here.
(BOOTH walks over across the room to MITCH's table. He looks up, and covers his book at BOOTH's approach)
BOOTH: (referring to the man onstage) Ha-ha, this guy a star, or what?
MITCH: You his agent?
BOOTH: No, I'm just a fan, you know, fan of the music.
(Cut briefly to: LINCOLN, sitting over at his usual table, eying BOOTH warily)
BOOTH: (in a whisper to MITCH) So, what label are you with?
MITCH: I'm an independent.
BOOTH: Ohhh! You know, me and my roommate, we had a band in college. Weren't half bad. I mean, all the A&R guys, they'd sit in the front there. What are you doing all the way in the back?
(Cut briefly to: LINCOLN, standing from his table and making his way over to where BOOTH and MITCH are)
MITCH: What's it to you?
BOOTH: Hey, what're you drinking?
(MITCH turns to look at his drink. BOOTH snatches his notepad away from him)
MITCH: Excuse me! Hey!
(BOOTH flips through the notebook. There is nothing but doodles inside)
BOOTH: Whoo. What the hell is this, doodles?
(LINCOLN approaches)
LINCOLN: Everything okay here?
BOOTH: What'dya say we step outside there? Come on.
(Cut to: outside the Checker Box. BOOTH and BRENNAN are questioning LINCOLN and MITCH)
BOOTH: I want to know why you're impersonating a talent scout.
MITCH: I don't know what you're talking about.
BOOTH: Answer the question, or I'll arrest you right now for fraud.
(MITCH sh**t a panicked glance to LINCOLN)
MITCH: ...But I didn't...
BOOTH: Wait a second, I get it. You two are working together. You knew that if there was a talent scout in the audience, more singers would show up at Open Mic Night, sell more booze, make more money...
LINCOLN: I just started the rumour. I asked Mitch to wear a suit, take some notes...
MITCH: I didn't do anything wrong. It was just a job.
BOOTH: Just a job, right. Give Tommy the idea that he was going to get his own contract...
MITCH: I didn't hurt anybody.
BRENNAN: You lied to them. You exploited their need for attention. That's cruel!
MITCH: (to LINCOLN) I'm not going down for your crap.
BOOTH: I get it. Tommy figures it all out, there's an argument, it escalates. (to LINCOLN) He confronts you.
LINCOLN: No! No, I swear it. Tommy knew nothing about Mitch - no one did.
BOOTH: You pull this scam again and I swear I'll arrest both of you for conspiracy, fraud and misrepresentation, you got me?
MITCH: Yes. (BOOTH leans in menacingly) Sir!
(LINCOLN gulps)
BOOTH: (to BRENNAN) Come on. (They turn to leave, BOOTH stops and turns back) And don't even think about leaving town, because both of you are under investigation for m*rder.
(BOOTH and BRENNAN walk away)
BRENNAN: They are?
BOOTH: No, I just don't like them.
(Cut to: PAM sitting in a BMW outside the Checker Box, with a camera. She holds it up)
(Cut to: PAM's view through the camera lens. She is taking pictures of BOOTH)

ACT 3
[Open: Medico Legal Lab - Zack's office. HODGINS enters]
HODGINS: How's it coming Zack?
ZACK: I'm still looking. The shaving was wafer thin and conformed to the curvature -
HODGINS: I need the bones, man.
ZACK: (confused) as do I Hodgins.
HODGINS: I need to swab the ligature furrows for elemental analysis...
ZACK: Did you know that I sang too?
HODGINS: ...What?
ZACK: As a child.
HODGINS: You?
ZACK: My parents felt that singing lessons would help integrate me socially.
HODGINS: Really.
ZACK: Yes. I was quite good. I received acclaim and a new stature amongst the parents of my peers.
HODGINS: What about your actual peers?
ZACK: My mother said they were jealous, and not to worry about it.
HODGINS: Jealous... of your singing. (ZACK nods, HODGINS laughs) Yeah, I'm trying Zack, but I just, I can't see it.
ZACK: (bursts into a rendition of "Love is a Many Splendored Thing" by Frank Sinatra) "Love is a many splendored thing! It's the April rose that only grows in the early spring..."
(cut briefly to: the hall outside Zack's office. Passersby have stopped outside the door to hear who is singing so nicely. ANGELA and CAM are among them, beginning to come inside the room)
ZACK: (con'd) "...when your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing! Yes true love's, a many splendored thing!"
(cut to: the crowd outside, all cheering and clapping wildly. ANGELA makes faux wolf whistling noises)
(cut to: ZACK, looking modest)
ANGELA: Wow. That was great! That was great!
ZACK: Thank you. I should get back to work now.
HODGINS: Listen Pavarotti, I need the C5 vertebra, the hyoid and the temporal bone.
ZACK: We need a w*apon!
HODGINS: And by IDing the particulates in the wounds, I can give you more to go on.
(They exchange a look - ZACK seems to concede, and HODGINS takes the bones)
HODGINS: Thanks for the concert.
(HODGINS exits, drawing ZACK's attention back to the door)
ZACK: Is there something you need?
(cut to: door, where HODGINS is exiting, and ANGELA and CAM are still standing, stunned)
CAM: No!
ANGELA: Oh, no, I'm just doing my... my...
CAM: Thanks...
(They exit. On her way out, ANGELA looks at ZACK, mouths 'wow' and gives him two thumbs up)
(Cut to: The Royal Diner. BOOTH AND BRENNAN are sitting at the bar)
BOOTH: I get it when a college kid wants to be a rock star, but half of those singers were over 30! Do they really think they're going to be famous?
BRENNAN: The need to stand out from the crowd is innate.
BOOTH: (scoffs) It's obnoxious!
BRENNAN: You were the best sn*per when you were in the army!
BOOTH: I was just doing my job, okay? Well.
BRENNAN: And that set you apart from the others.
BOOTH: Bones, we're talking about singing some nightmarish Broadway songs.
BRENNAN: Booth, It doesn't matter. Whoever is best has the status and power... and becomes the superior mate.
BOOTH: Yeah, well I tell you that some of those people are not going to be mating, that's for sure.
BRENNAN: But they will have the power and prestige. You enjoy it because you are a superb agent.
BOOTH: You think?
BRENNAN: Yes, of course. Since I am the best in my field, it would be self destructive for me to work with someone who's beneath me.
BOOTH: Oh. Okay. Well that's good. 'Cause, um, you know, I have to be honest here. Sometimes I think that you think you're better than me.
BRENNAN: Well, objectively, I am more intelligent...
BOOTH: There you go...
BRENNAN: In certain areas, and in others... I understand my limitations, and I... admire your expertise.
BOOTH: Huh. You admire me?
BRENNAN: ...In certain areas of expertise.
BOOTH: Well, I admire your expertise. You have a whole... science thing.
BRENNAN: Thank you. I'm an author, too.
BOOTH: I know BRENNAN: Best selling, and that also gives me elevated status.
BOOTH: Here comes the ego BRENNAN: No, I'm not saying that society is correct to elevate me. I'm not saying that I deserve the elevation... I'm just saying... that it occurs. Society should elevate scholars and teachers not actors and athletes.
(BOOTH's cell phone rings)
BOOTH: Yeah, what about cops?
BRENNAN: They're very important.
(BOOTH answers his phone)
BOOTH: Yeah, it's Agent Booth
(cut to: PAM NUNAN, sitting in her car)
PAM: It's Pam. Pam Nunan.
(cut back to BOOTH)
BOOTH: How can I help you, Miss Nunan?
(the camera proceeds to cut back and forth between PAM and BOOTH, depending on who is speaking)
PAM: Are you available to meet?
BOOTH: I'm sorry, uh... how did you get my number?
PAM: Your office patched me through. I said I was your mother.
BOOTH: (stunned, then recovers) Yeah, Dr. Brennan and I can meet with you.
PAM: No. Just you.
BOOTH: Well if it's relevant to the case, Ms. Nunan, I think it would be important that Dr. Brennan-
PAM: I can be at your office in a half hour, but you have to meet me alone.
BOOTH: I... I'm sorry, is this about Tommy?
(the camera cuts to an image of the outside of the Royal Diner. We can see the top of a car at the bottom of the screen. The camera moves lower and lower, until we see that it is PAM, sitting in her car, watching BOOTH and BRENNAN, sitting inside the restaurant)
PAM: What else would it be about Agent Booth?
(cut back to: BOOTH)
BOOTH: ...Okay. A half hour. (He hangs up the phone)
BRENNAN: What'd she want?
BOOTH: She wants to see me. Without you.
BRENNAN: Did she say why?
BOOTH: Probably because you make her feel uncomfortable.
BRENNAN: How so?
BOOTH: Well because... You're you. You're a well adjusted woman.
BRENNAN: And a bestselling author. I was on the New York Times list for 18 weeks and I won the Ed....
(They exchange a look. BRENNAN sees BOOTH's point)
(cut to: FBI - Booth's office. BOOTH and PAM are entering)
BOOTH: Right this way PAM: I really appreciate you seeing me BOOTH: Well, it's my job.
PAM: That's precious, it's your job BOOTH: You said you had information about the-
PAM: Hockey fan! (she gestures to one of his posters) I have that same print at my office. And it's Pam. I have season tickets to the Capitals, we should go sometime.
BOOTH: ...Ms. Nunan, about the case...
PAM: Seeley, please. Pam. I need to ask you something.
BOOTH: Okay, well usually I ask the questions-
PAM: Are you dating Dr. Brennan?
BOOTH: No! She's my partner.
PAM: I see.
(cut briefly to: image of PARKER on BOOTH's desk)
PAM: Your nephew?
BOOTH: It's my son.
PAM: You're married?
BOOTH: I'm not. Listen, I'm, I'm kind of busy here Ms. Nunan PAM: I brought you something.
(PAM brings out a small wrapped bag from her purse and hands it to BOOTH, who begins to unwrap it. He pulls out a pair of green socks)
BOOTH: Okay...
PAM: I know you've got a thing for socks.
BOOTH: How did you, uh...
PAM: I noticed them last time. On the outside, you're this big tough FBI guy... but really you're just like me. Unpredictable. Like Tommy was.
BOOTH: ...Please...
PAM: I know. We shouldn't talk about our old flames. Especially when we're just getting to know each other.
BOOTH: Ms Nunan, (he puts the socks down on his desk) you said you had information about Tommy Sour's m*rder.
PAM: Really? I have faith you'll find out who k*ll him. And Tommy wouldn't want me to grieve forever. (her eyes wander) Look at all these commendations... You're really great at your job, aren't you? (she bends down t pick up the socks, and hand them to Booth, moving closer) It's one of the reasons I'm drawn to you.
BOOTH: (backing off) Ma'am, this is way inappropriate.
PAM: (laughing) Ma'am! That is so cute! I can't wait to tell my mom you just said that. Well. Bye for now.
(She exits. BOOTH stares after her warily)
(cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Brennan's office. BRENNAN and SWEETS are watching a video of TOMMY SOUR on a computer. TOMMY's MySpace page is visible on the screen behind the video. He is singing "The Biggest Part of Me" by Ambrosia)
TOMMY (on screen): "Sunrise! There's a new sun rising..."
(cut to: BOOTH entering BRENNAN's office)
BOOTH: What are you watching?
BRENNAN: Oh, Dr. Sweets found Tommy Sour's MySpace video.
BOOTH: He's got an okay voice. But he's trying a bit hard, don't you think?
S: Yeah, there are two types of performers. Presentational singers crave attention, it's ego- driven. The representational singer wants the audience to feel. It's about invoking a cathartic experience.
BOOTH: He's showing off SWEETS: Presentational. Easy on the eyes, easy to forget. One hit wonder at best. Like Chumbawamba.
BRENNAN: Chumba-whata?
(BOOTH and SWEETS exchange a look)
SWEETS: Tubthumping? Oh come on, are you serious? It's a great song! It's anthemic!
BRENNAN: So this is all simple psychology to you?
SWEETS: People's actions are motivated by their need. When we discover our needs, we discover who we are. So yes.
BRENNAN: No, society makes us who we are, not psychology. Society shapes our actions. Culture compels us, not some toilet training mishap.
(BOOTH pulls SWEETS's chair to one side and places a chair in the middle of them, which he sits in)
BOOTH: Okay, look, I'm just going to break you two up, you're giving me a headache. If you keep this fighting up, no one's getting dessert.
SWEETS: Aw, we're not fighting. It's just a collegial debate, right?
BRENNAN: (surprised, and undecided) Right. (to BOOTH) How'd it go with Pam?
(BOOTH isn't sure how to answer)
SWEETS: Wait, you saw her again?
BOOTH: What's the big deal Sweets? She just gave me a pair of socks!
(BRENNAN laughs)
BOOTH: What? It's not funny.
SWEETS: It's not funny.
BRENNAN: Why did I laugh?
SWEETS: Pam Nunan controls your emotional agenda through seeming vulnerability followed by generosity. It's classic manipulation.
BOOTH: Then I'll just mail the socks back.
(BRENNAN points to the computer)
BRENNAN: Look! Tommy was about to release a CD.
(cut to: close up of a line at bottom of video reading "DEBUT CD; "I CAN'T DO BETTER THAN YOU", COMING SOON!")
BOOTH: "I Can't Do Better Than You"?
BRENNAN: Wonder if Pam thought that was meant for her.
SWEETS: Yeah, she probably saw secret messages in all of his songs.
BRENNAN: Until I was thirteen, I wanted to be the next Cindy Lauper.
BOOTH: I'd say you're kidding, but I don't think you know how to kid.
BRENNAN: The other girls and I referred to her as 'rad'.
(Cut to: SWEETS, hiding a small smile)
BRENNAN: My mother said that I sang just as well.
BOOTH: Well as Cindy Lauper?
BRENNAN: Yes.
SWEETS: Mother's do that. It's healthy.
BRENNAN: No, this wasn't just flattery. My mother told me that I sang 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' better than she did.
(BOOTH laughs)
SWEETS: It was an expression of affection, Dr. Brennan. Not an objective evaluation of your abilities.
BRENNAN: Well, I think you're wrong.
BOOTH: Okay then. Go ahead. Belt it out.
BRENNAN: No!
SWEETS: Yeah! Come on, give us a few bars.
BRENNAN: Absolutely not!
BOOTH: Yeah, come on!
BRENNAN: I can't just burst into song! I have to have music, and... an appropriate atmosphere... of frivolity.
B: Diva! Forensic genius, bestselling author, better than Cindy Lauper...
(Cut to: SWEETS notices the screen. TOMMY is singing to HELEN again)
SWEETS: Wait, look. Freeze the video.
(BRENNAN does. SWEETS points to DAX)
SWEETS: Look at him.
BRENNAN: Tommy is singing to the woman next to him. The one who shushed us.
SWEETS: His corrugator muscles are furrowed... his lips are tight...
(BOOTH, unsure of what this means, is attempting to use SWEETS analysis as direction to imitate the face DAX is making and understand)
SWEETS: ...teeth clenched... his mentalis is crinkled...
(SWEETS notices BOOTH's attempt at imitating the face. He begins to backtrack, explaining again)
SWEETS: The corrugator muscles are...
BRENNAN: We know.
BOOTH: I don't know. I don't know that.
SWEETS: He appears to be very angry. Like, 'get out of my way!' angry.
BRENNAN: He plays the guitar.
BOOTH: Yeah?
BRENNAN: (triumphantly) That's how Tommy died.
(cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Forensics Platform. BRENNAN, BOOTH, CAM, ANGELA, ZACK and HODGINS are standing in a circle at one end of the platform. BRENNAN is doing a demonstration with a block of cheese. She pulls a piece of wire through it, cutting it almost effortlessly)
BRENNAN: The guitar string could definitely be the m*rder w*apon.
BOOTH: Because it cut the cheese?
(everyone except BRENNAN has a quiet chuckle)
BRENNAN: Because the exemplar wound approximates the tool marks on the v*ctim's C5.
CAM: Yeah, he knew that. He just wanted to say 'cut the cheese'.
(SWEETS chuckles loudly. BOOTH joins him. BRENNAN rolls her eyes)
BRENNAN: Okay Hodgins, you are the guitar player.
(HODGINS moves into place)
BRENNAN: Zack, you are Tommy.
(ZACK appears to have anticipated this and has already g*n to move into place)
SWEETS: Re-enactment. Fascinating.
ZACK: Not for me. I'm always the one that gets k*ll.
HODGINS: Dude, you're the singer. Singer was the vic here.
(ZACK accepts this, turns around)
BRENNAN: Tommy was strangled from behind with a wire, or guitar string...
(HODGINS demonstrates on ZACK)
BOOTH: Guitar string was pulled tight...
CAM: Slicing his throat and trachea...
ANGELA: Of course!
CAM: As he lost consciousness, he fell forward...
(ZACK demonstrates)
BRENNAN: Fracturing his chin...
BOOTH: Wait a second, he was a big guy, but according to your scenario, he was passive.
CAM: Nothing in the data suggests that he fought back.
BOOTH: Wait a second, Tommy was, he was high, he was toasted. That could have dulled his reflexes.
BRENNAN: This also explains the shaving of the vertebra. A guitar string would slice a wafer thin sliver of bone as he dropped to the ground.
(SWEETS is astounded. He throws his arms up and lets them drop)
SWEETS: Amazing.
(Cut to: FBI - Interrogation Room. BOOTH is interrogating DAX)
BOOTH: Tommy Sour was strangled, Dax. Possibly with a guitar string. Now I know that, uh, you didn't like him singing to your girl.
DAX: The hell are you talking about? My girl's in Texas.
BOOTH: Oh. (BOOTH pulls out a screen sh*t taken from TOMMY's video showing DAX looking angry) That.
DAX: That's Helen. We perform together. You know she's married, right? To someone else.
BOOTH: Well, why d'you look so angry?
DAX: Because Tommy was a son of a bitch. Look, I... I'm feelin' a little paranoid in here. Like I'm being persecuted.
BOOTH: Persecuted, really? Maybe because you're... feeling a little guilty?
DAX: ...A couple of years ago, I introduced Tommy to my trainer, Jason. Jason runs a Wellness centre. He needed personal trainers and Tommy was a trainer.
BOOTH: Jason? As in Jason Bergman?
DAX: Yeah! that's right man, you know him?
BOOTH: Yeah we've met!
DAX: Tommy and Jason wanted to open up a place together. One they owned. So they went out and got a loan. Tommy... stole the money! It was 50 grand man. Tommy used the money to produce his own CD. High end musicians, arrangements, publicity, the works. So that's why I'm harbouring the negative vibes, dude.
BOOTH: Yeah, I can only imagine how Jason feels.
(cut to: Valera Wellness gym. BOOTH and BRENNAN are walking rapidly down the hall towards DR. JASON's office)
BOOTH: So I contacted the bank, Dr. Jason is on the hook for the full amount of the loan.
BRENNAN: Which he conveniently forget when we spoke to him before.
(They knock repetitively on the office door)
BOOTH: All right, Bones...
(A TRAINER approaches BOOTH and BRENNAN)
TRAINER: If you're looking for Dr. Jason, he didn't come in today. I've been calling him, but his cell isn't on.
BRENNAN: Is that unusual?
TRAINER: This place is his whole life. You could call him day or night, he'd always answer.
(BOOTH pulls out his cell)
BOOTH: (To TRAINER) Great, thanks. (into phone) Yeah, hi, it's Agent Booth. I need a BOLO for a Dr. Jason Bergman. Wanted for first degree m*rder.
(cut to: Medico Legal Lab. BRENNAN is in ZACK's office as HODGINS is walking past. BRENNAN moves quickly to follow him)
BRENNAN: Oh! Dr. Hodgins!
HODGINS: Dr. B, what's up?
BRENNAN: Did you swab the C5 vertebra for elemental trace?
HODGINS: I swabbed the C5 vertebra, the hyoid and the temporal bone. Analyzing the particulates now.
BRENNAN: Well, I'll need your results as soon as possible.
HODGINS: Okay. I'm on it. Hey, how'd it go with guitar guy?
BRENNAN: Booth doesn't think it's him! No motive!
HODGINS: But... the wound...
BRENNAN: No, it's definitely a wire or a metal string of some kind but not from him. Booth suspects the manager of the wellness center.
HODGINS: So you're using from some wire used it a gym or by a physical therapist.
BRENNAN: Yes. Assuming that it was a crime of passion, the k*ll would have used something handy. (her phone rings, she answers) Brennan. Okay, I'll meet you there. (she hangs up, and says to HODGINS) I need those results.
HODGINS: Right away.
(BRENNAN leaves)
(cut to: FBI - Interrogation Room. BRENNAN and BOOTH are interrogating DR. JASON)
DR. JASON: I quit my job, decided to move out of town. So what?
BOOTH: Officer pulled you over on the 0-5-0. You've been travelling non-stop since... yesterday morning?
DR. JASON: Is that a crime?
BRENNAN: Maybe. (DR. JASON looks at her) We know about the small business loan.
DR. JASON: Then you also know that I'm the last person in the world that would want Tommy dead. With him out of the picture, I'm responsible for the whole nut.
(BRENNAN doesn't understand. She looks to BOOTH for clarification)
DR. JASON: 50 grand! (he lowers his head) I couldn't see another way out.
BOOTH: So you thought you could hide from the bank.
DR. JASON: I'm not married. I've got no coast family. So yeah, I thought I could disappear. Just fall off the grid. You hear about it all the time.
BOOTH: I think you were pissed and you just... snapped. Hm?
That place, was everything to you. Tommy ruined it for you, so you ruined him.
(JASON laughs)
DR. JASON: You know what I think, Agent Booth? I think motive, without evidence, is like riding a stationary bike. You get nowhere, fast.
BOOTH: (smugly) Like right now?
BRENNAN: Dr. Bergman, did you use any wires, or wire like instruments at the gym or in your chiropractic practice?
(JASON looks at BOOTH and BRENNAN warily, then makes a decision)
DR. JASON: Any further questions will have to go through a lawyer.
(The interrogation room door bursts open. HODGINS enters)
BOOTH: Yep, well... whoa.
BRENNAN: Hodgins.
HODGINS: Sorry to barge in.
BOOTH: Whoooooa! no! you can't just barge in here!
HODGINS: (to BRENNAN) there was elemental evidence on the vertebra!
You wanted to know ASAP.
BRENNAN: What's the evidence?
HODGINS: It's phyllosilicate minerals and aluminum oxides.
BRENNAN: Oh.
HODGINS: Yeah.
BOOTH: What? English!
DR. JASON: It's clay.
HODGINS: Hey, very good.
DR. JASON: I have nothing to do with clay.
HODGINS: I know, you're totally going to be cleared.
BOOTH: Hey, you can't say that! This is my place!
HODGINS: And there was silver conticulates embedded in the deposit.
BRENNAN: On his vertebra?
HODGINS: Yeah. There's a company called 'clay global' which infuses sculpting clay with silver power. They sell direct via the internet. And, get this - they recently shipped a package of the clay to the other unit of our v*ctim's duplex.
ACT 4
(Cut to: Tommy Sour and Adam Matthew's shared apartment. BRENNAN and BOOTH hand ADAM MATTHEWS a warrant. The alarm clock begins going off in the background)
MATTHEWS: A warrant? To search my place?
BOOTH: Ah. He can read.
MATTHEWS: (as BRENNAN searches) I'm the one who reported Tommy missing. Why would I be hiding anything?
BOOTH: Because you k*ll Tommy and then reported him missing to cover your own ass.
(MATTHEWS looks over his shoulders. He sees BRENNAN rifling through his things)
MATTHEWS: Hey, excuse me? What are you doing?
BRENNAN: Oh. Are you asking because you have an interest in forensics, Mr. Matthews?
MATTHEWS: What?
(BRENNAN holds up a wire)
BRENNAN: This clay cutting wire is consistent with the object used to k*ll Tommy Sour. I'm testing it for bl*od.
MATTHEWS: Just look at it. There's no bl*od on it.
(BRENNAN wipes a swab over the wire)
BRENNAN: If the liquid turns blue, it means this wire came in contact with human bl*od.
(She places the swab in a test tube filled with liquid. It turns blue)
MATTHEWS: Wait -
BOOTH: Adam Matthews, you are under arrest for the m*rder of Tommy Sour.
MATTHEWS: Wait wait wait you don't understand okay? I didn't want to! The noise was-
BRENNAN: The noise?
MATTHEWS: Yeah, you hear over there? The alarm clock. These walls are so thin and I needed to - to work, to concentrate for my show. And Tommy, he'd just sing at the top of his lungs, day and night, he'd never ever shut up. I begged him to lower his voice, just sing quietly, but he didn't care.
BRENNAN: And that gives you the right to strangle him into silence?
MATTHEWS: No I... I was just trying to scare him. He was taking his trash to the alley and singing at the top of his lungs, so I went after him! But he's bigger than me, I never thought I could k*ll him!
BOOTH: He was stoned. Couldn't fight back.
MATTHEWS: I just... I pulled on the wire, and he fell down. And he was dead. And it was quiet. It was finally quiet.
(BOOTH and BRENNAN exchange a look)
(Cut to: Checker Box restaurant. BRENNAN enters. ANGELA, CAM, ZACK, HODGINS, BOOTH and SWEETS are already there at various tables, having conversations with each other and the other patrons. BOOTH stands as BRENNAN enters)
BRENNAN: What's going on? Why did you call me here, Booth?
BOOTH: Your need to sing in front of a live audience, it's innate Bones.
BRENNAN: No way...
BOOTH: Hey, I've got the music, the frivolity. What else do you need?
(The others start clapping and cheering her on)
HODGINS: Come on Dr. Brennan, you can do it! We're here for you, we're here for you!
(Piano starts playing "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cindy Lauper)
SWEETS: (pushing her in the direction of the stage) We're very controlled Dr. Brennan, I think it would be a good idea for you to let yourself go.
BRENNAN: Really? What about you.
SWEETS: Hey, I will be singing 'Lime in Da Coconut' after you. You will be extremely impressed. As was my Abnormal Psychology class in college. This opportunity is a gift from Agent Booth. Trust yourself, trust your friends. Let 'er rip, let's hear it!
(Everyone cheers. BRENNAN allows herself to be pushed onto the stage, where she grins bemusedly at the crowd. After a moment's pause, she removes her jacket to wild applause, grabs the microphone and begins to sing)
BRENNAN: "Come home, in the morning light, my mother says 'when you gonna live your life right?'..."
(Cut to: the entrance to the Checker Box. PAM NUNAN enters.)
BRENNAN: (con'd) "Oh mama dear we're not the fortunate ones, and girls they wanna have fun..."
(BOOTH playfully pulls out his lighter, swaying it to the music. The others laugh, some doing the same)
BRENNAN: (con'd) "Oh girls just wanna have fun!"
(Everyone cheers as the instrumental begins and Brennan begins dancing on stage. The camera cuts to Pam again, who is now standing at the bar, looking depressed and nervous)
BRENNAN: (con'd) "The phone rings, in the middle of the night my father yells 'what you gonna do with your life?'...Oh daddy dear you know you're still number one, but girls they wanna have fun..."
(Camera cuts to the crowd, having a blasts, laughing at BRENNAN's energy and enthusiasm. BOOTH in particular, is practically jumping in his seat.)
(Camera cuts to PAM, staring at BOOTH in disgust)
PAM: (to BOOTH) Look at me. Not her.
BRENNAN: (con'd) "Oh girls just want to have... that's all they really want, ohh-ohhh-ohhha!...
(PAM reaches over into her purse and pulls out a g*n)
PAM: Seeley! (No one hears her over BRENNAN's singing) SEELEY!
(BOOTH looks over)
PAM: I'm doing this for us.
(BRENNAN is still singing, dancing on stage. PAM cocks her g*n and aims it directly at BRENNAN. BOOTH draws his w*apon, but it's too late to sh**t, so he instead leaps from his seat to get in the way of PAM's g*n. PAM fires the b*llet, piercing his chest. BOOTH stumbles backwards. The music stops, people start screaming. PAM stares, shocked and horrified at what just happened. BOOTH falls backwards, BRENNAN jumps off the stage to his side. PAM is still horrified, but becomes angry when she sees BRENNAN rushing to BOOTH's aid. She aims her g*n again. BRENNAN grabs BOOTH's abandoned w*apon and fires it at PAM, sh**ting her in the throat before turning her attention back to BOOTH. The others exchange horrified and confused looks, before settling in and beginning to make decisions)
HODGINS: Zack! Call 911!
(We see BRENNAN, kneeling over BOOTH, who is blinking up at the ceiling with a dazed expression, clearly not seeing much of anything. She is applying pressure to the wound. BRENNAN is calling out to him, her cries getting more and more desperate)
BRENNAN: Booth, you're going to be fine. I'm right here. God. You're gonna do this. You're gonna be fine. You're going to make this.
(SWEETS moves to the presumed dead body of PAM, retrieves the g*n she fired at BOOTH)
BRENNAN: Come on! Come on! Booth! You're gonna make it! COME ON! COME ON! BOOTH COME ON! Come on come on come on. You're gonna make this, come on. Oh god.
(CAM and ANGELA stand in a petrified shock. They don't know what to do. They don't know how to handle this.)
BRENNAN: You're gonna do this. Come on! COME ON! Come on Booth! It's gonna be fine, come on Booth.
(The camera switches angles to what we assume is from BOOTH's vision. It's slowly fading to black on BRENNAN's petrified expression)
BRENNAN: Come on Booth no. No, come on Booth... COME ON BOOTH!
END.
