THE BONES ON THE BLUE LINE
(Open: Rock Creek subway Tunnel. Sweets is sitting and listening to his ipod when the guy next to him receives a text message and sits down next to him. Shocked. He starts to tear up.)
SWEETS: Uh, excuse me. Are you all right?
MARCO: Yes. Yes. Yes, thanks. Yes, in fact, I'm great. I've been fighting leukemia for the past eight years and now I just got a text; I'm cancer free.
SWEETS: That's awesome. Congratulations, man.
MARCO: It's... Oh, my God. I've been on hold for almost half my life. No more. No. I'm gonna travel, I-I'm going to sleep with exotic women in exotic places, I-I'm gonna do anything I want.
SWEETS: Hey, that sounds like a good plan. Congrats, man.
(He shakes Marco's hand.)
(Cut to: Founding Father. Booth and Brennan are meeting with Riku Iwanaga. She has come all the way from Japan to interview Brennan about her latest book, Bone of Contention.)
BRENNAN: Ms. Iwanaga has come all the way over from Japan just to interview me about my new book.
BOOTH: So her book is big in Japan, too?
RIKU IWANAGA: Yes, very popular. Spine-tingling.
BOOTH: Spine-tingling is good, Bones.
BRENNAN: Well - well, except when it indicates a dangers nerve disorder. Well, she's also interested in how you work.
BOOTH: Oh, sure. As long as we keep you safe.
RIKU IWANAGA: That is what Agent Andy would say in your books.
(The building starts to shake)
RIKU IWANAGA: It is an earthquake.
BOOTH: No, no, no, no. It's not earthquake. This - this isn't California.
BRENNAN: Well, in both 1811 and 1812, large tremors shook D.C. And again in 1828. (The building shakes again, harder this time) We can discuss this later...
BOOTH: Okay, that's pretty... Whoa.
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab. Cam is entering the building as it starts to shake)
(Cut to: Rock Creek subway Tunnel. The car is shaking, water is spurting out of places and the workers are fleeing the area)
MAN IN SUBWAY CAR: What's going on?
TUNNEL WORKER #1: Let's get out of there! The main water valve just broke! Go! Go! It's a flood!
(Water starts pouring into the tunnel. The subway car rides right through the flood of water and a body washes up against the window. Sweets and Marco see it.)
MARCO: Oh, my God. What the hell is that?!
(The car starts to shake and the passengers are thrown around. Marco hits his head on the pole and falls to the ground. Sweets gets on the ground, pulls him into his lap and checks for a pulse. Marco's dead.)
(Cut to: Tunnels. A few hours later. Marco's body is being put into a body bag as Sweets watches from the side. Booth and Brennan arrive at the crime scene.)
BOOTH: Look, there's Sweets.
BRENNAN: Oh, he looks very upset.
BOOTH: Well, when I talked to him, he said the guy died in his arms.
COLIN CASEY: You guys with the FBI?
BOOTH: FBI, yeah. We're here about the, uh, human remains.
COLIN CASEY: That's him right over there.
BRENNAN: No, uh, the skeleton.
COLIN CASEY: Oh, right. Uh, Officer Grant. She can help you.
BOOTH: All right, I'll tell you what, I'll meet up with you. I'm gonna go see Sweets.
COLIN CASEY: Officer McKenna Grant is just right over there.
BRENNAN: Thanks.
TUNNEL WORKER #2: Bring me a line - get that pump working again.
(Booth is by Sweets)
BOOTH: You all right?
SWEETS: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
BOOTH: You don't look fine.
SWEETS: Oh, it's..you know, a whole subway car full of people and uh, worst injury is a broken arm, except for this guy.
BOOTH: I can see that.
SWEETS: I was just talking to him, um, when-when it hit and he just b*at cancer.
BOOTH: Alright, look. I tell you what...just go over here and have a seat. Try to relax.
SWEETS: I, uh. You know, h-he talked about traveling and sleeping with exotic women, and he was gone - just like that.
BOOTH: Just have a seat, alright? Just relax, alright? And I'm gonna go check on Bones and I'll come back and I'll take you to the office, alright?
SWEETS: That's fine.
BOOTH: Okay?
SWEETS: Uh, huh. It's no problem.
(Officer McKenna Grant is showing Brennan to the body when Booth joins them)
OFFICER MCKENNA GRANT: Your friend said the skeleton washed up against the train window; would have freaked me out.
BRENNAN: Booth, this is Officer Grant with the transit police.
BOOTH: The water mains..they broke all through the city.
OFFICER GRANT: Yeah and this station was closed for construction, that's probably why it flooded like that.
BRENNAN: This is a male. Early 30s. Dead at least a week. Probably washed out in the tunnel when the main broke.
RIKU IWANAGA: This could be quite a thrilling opening for your next book.
BOOTH: Yeah. What did she say?
BRENNAN: Never mind.
[OPENING CREDITS]
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Forensics Platform.)
BRENNAN: There are striations on the bones from animals scavenging.
DAISY: Probably rats from the subway tunnel. That explains why there so little tissue left.
RIKU IWANAGA: Like the remains in your book Bred in the Bone.
BRENNAN: Oh, no. Those remains were eaten by weasels, not rats. It's a different genus altogether, although dentition is similar.
CAM: There's some kind of viscous film on the humerus and scapula. I'll take a swab for Hodgins.
ANGELA: So, other than the cancer survivor who died in Sweets' subway car, there were no other fatalities; just a couple chimneys down and some stuff falling off the shelves. Really rotten luck for that poor guy...and this one, too, apparently.
ANGELA: (noticing Riku) Hello. I'm Angela Montenegro.
BRENNAN: Oh, Ms. Iwanaga is interviewing me for a Japanese magazine.
(They bow)
RIKU IWANAGA: In her books, you must be Amanda.
ANGELA: Oh, well, I have a lot more fun than Amanda.
BRENNAN: Angela, perhaps you could take Ms.Iwanaga to my office. We can discuss my book a little later.
RIKU IWANAGA: Of course.
ANGELA: Right this way.
(Sweets enters the platform)
DAISY: Lance? What are you doing here?
SWEETS: I came to offer my-my services. Earthquakes can cause psychological trauma.
DAISY: Yes, for you, baby. What you've been through...
SWEETS: I'm fine, Daisy.
CAM: Sweets, you saw somebody die.
DAISY: I know my Lancelot. You needed to see me, didn't you?
SWEETS: No, I'm just trying to do my job.
DAISY: (dejected) Oh.
BRENNAN: Booth told you to go home. He knows about things like this, Sweets.
CAM: We'll call if we need you, I promise. We'll have Hodgins drive you home.
(Sweets hesistates but then walks away)
DAISY: Bye, Lancelot.
(He waves goodbye. Daisy is upset that Sweets is upset and won't talk to her)
BRENNAN: Note the v*ctim's clavicle.
CAM: It's dented.
DAISY: And blue.
BRENNAN: There's also a blue nick on the C-7.
CAM: Something blue pierced his clavicle and went through to the back of his neck. That would have sliced through the carotid artery.
BRENNAN: Ms. Wick, take molds of the clavicle for a possible w*apon and swab the blue pigment for Hodgins.
(Cut to: Hodgin's Car. Hodgins is giving Sweets a ride home)
SWEETS: You didn't have to give me a lift. I have a car.
HODGINS: Seeing someone die, Sweets..you don't just go on with your day after something like that.
SWEETS: Right, of course. I was just... you know,I thought i-if I could help other people, then...
HODGINS: Yes, but you know, sometimes you can't.
SWEETS: Eight years of chemo and radiation. He said he was going to do all the things that he'd been putting off, and then he was gone.
HODGINS: I'm sorry, man.
SWEETS: I just don't... I don't want to disappear without living the life that I want to live.
HODGINS: Well, hey, how about you start by taking the afternoon off?
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab. Angela is in Brennan's office with Riku)
RIKU IWANAGA: Amanda is the best friend of Dr. Reichs in the books. Are you also friends with Dr.Brennan?
ANGELA: Absolutely, yeah, we're, uh, we're best friends.
RIKU IWANAGA: I see. Amanda once had sex with Agent Andy. Then I assume you also have...
ANGELA: Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no. Not-not me. (Riku writes something down) Wha-what are you writing there? Stop writing. The books and life are not the same thing. Most of the time.
(Brennan enters)
BRENNAN: Okay, Ms. Iwanaga. I'm all yours.
RIKU IWANAGA: Excellent. Dr.Reichs' relationship with Agent Andy is based on you and Booth. The quite notorious sex life they share and...
BRENNAN: What? No, we are not them. They're fiction. (Riku writes something down) Wha-what are you writing? Uh, you stard writing before I answered.
ANGELA: She loves to write.
RIKU IWANAGA: Your readers feel the passion...
BRENNAN: My readers appreciate the intricate plots and the unique forensics. Why aren't you writing that down? That was interesting; what I just said.
(Daisy enters)
DAISY: Dr.Brennan.
BRENNAN: Ms. Wick.
DAISY: I found a tooth in the v*ctim's scapula. Oh, my gosh. Am I interrupting?
BRENNAN: A tooth? I'm sorry, Ms. Iwanaga. We can continue this later. Uh, gomen nasai.
(Brennan leaves)
RIKU IWANAGA: Do you and Amanda share an interest in painting?
ANGELA: Yes...(Riku starts writing again)..but listen, that does not mean that I had a thing with a Norwegian prince. You got that, right? That Amanda and I are different people? Belgian and Norwegian are not at all the same thing. Believe me.
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Forensics Platform)
DAISY: There. In the coracoid process. At first, I thought it was some kind of mineralized connective tissue, but then I remembered in your book, Dr. Reichs is confounded by the anomalous 13th rib.
BRENNAN: Note how you are able to retain the important facts from the book.
CAM: And what does all of this mean?
It's definitely a tooth. I tested it - a canine. And look here -he's missing his canine.
BRENNAN: Well, Someone extracted his tooth and surgically implanted it in his scapula?
CAM: Okay, if that's his tooth, what's that in the middle of it?
BRENNAN: Modified Osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis
CAM: Of course. It's a new surgery to restore sight.
DAISY: In your shoulder?
BRENNAN: They use the tooth as an anchor for a prosthetic lens.
CAM: So the v*ctim was blind.
BRENNAN: This is a rare operation. We should contact ophthalmologists in the area. One of them can probably ID the v*ctim.
(Hodgins enters)
HODGINS: I identified the blue substance on his bones as a polymer: paint or rubber, maybe dye. That's why I'd like to go searching for rat poop.
CAM: Of course you'd like that.
BRENNAN: Yes, the v*ctim was eaten by rats in the subway tunnels.
DAISY: Rat excrement will contain not only inorganic clues but digested remains from the v*ctim. That could give vs time of death, too.
CAM: Go for it.
HODGINS: Well, I'll need some help. (to Daisy) You seem to know your poop.
(Cut to: Subway tunnels. Hodgins and Daisy are looking for a rats nest. Daisy is taking pictures.)
DAISY: Did you get to the part in Bone of Contention where Kathy has to swim through the sewage tunnel looking for the k*ll's teeth?
HODGINS: Da, da, da, da, da. I'm on page three so far. I've been busy with the m*rder.
DAISY: I speed-read.
HODGINS: Yeah, of course you do. Hey! Rat poop. Let's bag that, okay? (he sees a rat) There's our furry little friends. Alright, there's gotta be a rat's nest nearby 'cause rat's stay close to home. So, keep your eyes open.
DAISY: Here's a trail of fecal matter.
HODGINS: Yep.
DAISY: I think it's Dr.Brennan's best book. People think that scientists aren't romantic but Dr.Brennan has a knack for the steamy.
HODGINS: Yeah, still waters run deep.
DAISY: Wait until you get to page 187. It is H.O.T! She describes this move that Agent Andy makes. Lance and I tried it a few times, and oh my god. The neighbors complained.
HODGINS: Rat poop, Miss Wick. Rat poop.
DAISY: You have to check it out. Rat nest!
HODGINS: Wow. As rat nests go, this is the mother ship. There's got to be some gift in here for us.
DAISY: Ventilation grates. The body could've been dropped through there.
HODGINS: Yeah, alright. Let's start bagging some excrement.
DAISY: A white cane. Our v*ctim was blind.
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Angela's Office. Angela & Daisy are sharing their findings with Cam.)
ANGELA: Martin Aragon. 30 years old. Lives in Kingman Park.
DAISY: His eye surgeon identified him.
ANGELA: He's a scribe.
CAM: I beg your pardon?
ANGELA: Seriously, he wrote letters for a living. His, uh, business partner's name is Sophia Meade.
DAISY: I don't like today one bit. This man was on the verge of maybe having his sight returned and Lance's dead friend from the subway just found out he was cured of leukemia.
CAM: Yeah, it's ironic.
DAISY: With all due respect, that's not irony. People may think it's irony but it's really just an unfortunate juxtaposition of events.
ANGELA: Well, guess they're gonna need a shorter word for that.
(Cut to: Founding Fathers. Brennan is having lunch with Riku.
RIKU IWANAGA: Dr.Brennan, why doesn't Agent Andy wear a "cocky" belt buckle?
BRENNAN: Because Andy isn't Booth but why does everyone think that?
RIKU IWANAGA: Agent Booth thinks he is. He says they are both brave and attractive.
BRENNAN: Well, he's wrong.
RIKU IWANAGA: You do not think he's attractive?
BRENNAN: Uh, I think his symmetry is pleasing, yes but Ms. Iwanaga, the characters in my books are really only there to further the forensics.
RIKU IWANAGA: I do not agree. The sex is very involving.
BRENNAN: Why does everyone think that? It's just sex.
RIKU IWANAGA: Imaginative sex.
BRENNAN: Okay, I only include that - and the personal interactions - to denote the passage of time. Wh-what are you writing? I only took conversational Japanese.
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Ookey Room. Hodgins is examining particulates under the microscope and Brennan's new book is sitting next to him on the desk. He picks up the book)
HODGINS: Page 187. (he reads) Oh, my God.
(Cam runs into Hodgins in the Hallway. He's on his way to see Angela.)
CAM: Hodgins.
One moment please. Personal privilege, point of order.
(Hodgins enters Angela's office holding up the book.)
ANGELA: How's your rat poop?
HODGINS: Page 187. Mind reading it aloud?
ANGELA: Page 187? I am not reading the sparky bits to you. You can get somebody else to do that, sicko.
HODGINS: Okay, fine. Read it to yourself then. (she starts to read) That's that thing that I do. Nobody else does that thing. It's my thing that I do. Right. It's not a well-known thing. It's, you know, my thing that I do.
ANGELA: Right, I remember. I was there.
HODGINS: You told Brennan about that thing I do.
ANGELA: It's a very good thing.
HODGINS: It's my thing. That I do. Did you tell her that it was my thing?
ANGELA: You mean, did I give you credit?
HODGINS: Yes. Did you?
ANGELA: No.
HODGINS: Good, 'cause I don't need her looking at me thinking about.. that thing I do.
ANGELA: Well, that's good then.
HODGINS: But now that thing I do is in print and every guy that reads that book is gonna give it a sh*t. (he sighs) Oh, well. You know I got other things that I do. My advice: only sleep with guys that can't read 'cause otherwise, you'll never be rid of me.
(He leaves)
(Cut to: Bone Room. Daisy is handing Brennan a skull when...)
DAISY: I'm very worried about Lance. I didn mean say that out loud. I just thought it so hard that it popped out of my mouth.
BRENNAN: Apology accepted.
DAISY: That guy dying right in front of him really freaked him out. He's very sensitive, not inured to death and mortality like you and I are.
BRENNAN: The pattern of this pitting...I believe it resulted from blowback.
DAISY: From a g*n?
BRENNAN: Most probably.
DAISY: The v*ctim was sh*t with a g*n and was standing in front of something glass.
BRENNAN: Which shattered and blew back into his skull.
DAISY: The b*llet must've been blue. Are there such things as blue b*ll*ts? That's for me to find out, right? Yes. 'Cause that's my job.
(Cut to: FBI Headquarters - Booth's Office. Booth is talking with Sophia Meade, Martin Aragon's business partner.)
SOPHIA MEADE: Martin and I have been business partners for six years. We've been writing letters for people since we got out of college.
BOOTH: How did he adjust to the fact that he was going blind?
SOPHIA: He loved reading and writing more than anything. The past couple of years he's been very down and depressed. That's why he got the operation.
BOOTH: Listen, how does this whole, uh, professional letter writing thing, work?
SOPHIA: Well, most people are unable to express themselves in a cogent manner; Martin and I know how to do that.
BOOTH: Does it pay well?
SOPHIA: $50 a page for simple letters.
BOOTH: 50 bucks?
SOPHIA: $250 for legalese.
BOOTH: So, uh, someone owes me money...
SOPHIA: You come to us, yes. Or if you got bad service, letters to the editor, congressmen even Dear John letters.
BOOTH: When was the last time you saw your partner?
SOPHIA: Last week. We don't work together every day. I have kids. I work from home.
BOOTH: So, uh, clients- did they ever want their money back?
SOPHIA: We have dissatisfied customers like any business but none's ever threatened us. You're welcome to look at our archives.
BOOTH: Oh, so you have copies of everything.
SOPHIA: Yes, on disk.
(Cut to: FBI Headquarters - Conference Room. A few hours later. Sweets & Booth are looking at the letters)
BOOTH: God, our v*ctim was an expert on eveything. I mean, look at all these letters here: parking tickets, income tax, court orders, the whole thing. I mean, it's getting to a pot where I'd want to k*ll him too. Sweets?
SWEETS: Yeah, yeah. Sorry.
BOOTH: You sure you're ready to come back to work?
SWEETS: Yeah, I'm fine.
BOOTH: You know, that guy on the subway? Another way to look at it is, um, that he died happy.
SWEETS: What?
BOOTH: Well, I mean, think about it. This guy gets this great news and what's he do? He shares it with a stranger.
SWEETS: You're gonna think I'm stupid for saying this but the whole thing...it felt like a message.
BOOTH: Right, a message. I believe in messages.
SWEETS: Yeah, it was like a message. "Go ye forth and live life to the fullest." Something like that.
BOOTH: Live life to its fullest.
SWEETS: Yeah.
BOOTH: People should do that more often. Moment to moment, day to day but they don't. (Booth finds something on the screen) Wait till you see this. Look at this letter right here. A letter actually written by the v*ctim. I mean, it's written by him and signed, uh, signed by him.
SWEETS: He's complaining about a sandwich frahchise. Says it's disgusting and should be shut down.
BOOTH: What? Yeah, but you know what? Keep reading; he kept the reply.
SWEETS: (reading) "You're destroying my career and my living. People have been k*ll for less." (to Booth) It's a death threat.
BOOTH: It's a death threat.

(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Ookey Room. Hodgins has a display set up)
HODGINS: I put together a time line made out of rat poop.
CAM: And now I'm in a sixth-grade science fair.
HODGINS: The oldest poop, containing human remains, dates from seven days ago. Now, I also found this.
CAM: Is that the color that was found on the bones?
HODGINS: Mhm. The same sub-micrometer blue polymer base material. Now, I'm running a scan companies at manufacture it to see if it's ever been used for amm*nit*on and check this out. Also found this.
CAM: Is that leather?
HODGINS: Mhm, it's a piece from the sole of a shoe.
CAM: The v*ctim's?
HODGINS: No. His we matched with DNA. This leather was found in a rat's stomach along with bits of the v*ctim. They were ingested at the same time.
CAM: This could've come from whoever k*ll Martin Aragon. What do you know. King of the lab.
HODGINS: Wow! That's a first. Usually I have to say it.
CAM: Yes, but I wanted to hear how it sounded with a touch of modesty.
(Cut to: FBI Headquarters - Interrogation Room. Stewart Bonder is sitting at the table. Booth enters.)
BOOTH: Stewart, hello. So, I spoke to Sammy's corporate office. I found out you lost your franchise in Rock Creek last month.
STEWART BONDER: What's this about?
BOOTH: They said at they pulled the plug on you because you got into, uh, what they called a, uh, altercation with one of the customers there. You two fought.
STEWART: Oh, yeah. That blind creep, Aragon. He comes in twice a week for three months. One day he gets sick and it's my fault. Those letters, they was just some kind of crazy vendetta. So, what's this? Son of a bitch coming after me again?
BOOTH: He's dead. He was m*rder.
STEWART: Well, then someone did the world a favor but it wasn't me. That bastard cost me over $100,000. I lost everything.
BOOTH: You wrote him back. Saying you'd k*ll him if he didn't stop writing to the head office.
STEWART: Ho-hold on, man. That's just something that you say, okay? I was going under. My wife left me. I offered him five free lunches but nothing was good enough for him.
Where were you last Thursday night? Anywhere near Rock Creek subway station?
STEWART: Why?
BOOTH: Why? A second ago you're happy he's dead, now you don't want to tell me anything?
STEWART: Man! Even from the grave this dude is ruining my life. Hey, look, I don't have to say nothing. I-I want one of those court-appointed lawyers.
BOOTH: Sure. Okay. Take about a couple of hours. Sit tight.
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Brennan's Office. Brennan and Riko are talking)
BRENNAN: I believe my books are popular because they introduce the reader to the world of forensic anthropology. Why aren't you writing? You uslly write down everything.
RIKU IWANAGA: Why did it take so long for Dr.Reichs to have sex with Agent Andy?
BRENNAN: For the same reason that she used stable isotos to determine that the v*ctim spent her childhood in East Timor. The oxygen isotopes we ingest through food and water are incorporated into the hydroxyl carbonic apatite of bone. You-you should be writing this down.
RIKU IWANAGA: Will she ever tell Andy about her affair with Ryan?
BRENNAN: That was inconsequential fluff, Ms. Iwanaga.
RIKU IWANAGA: It's why they fight in chapter six.
BRENNAN: Well, they identify the lotus tooth in chapter six.
RIKU IWANAGA: That is when their passion is released: page 187.
BRENNAN: Why are you only asking about things that mean nothing?
RIKU IWANAGA: Those are the things that mean everything.
(Cut to: Street - Day. Booth and Brennan are walking.)
BRENNAN: All anyone cares about are the characters.
BOOTH: Well, it's what they relate too, you know, makes the story real.
BRENNAN: No. The facts make it real. They're indisputable.
BOOTH: Okay, well, if you believed that, you wouldn't write it as well as you do.
BRENNAN: Angela helps me with those scenes.
BOOTH: What?
BRENNAN: Angela helps me.
BOOTH: Page 187?
BRENNAN: Angela. Though, I'm anxious to try it.
(She enters Founding Fathers)
BOOTH: Really?
(He follows)
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Angela's Office. Her and Sweets are going over the letters.)
ANGELA: So, these are all the letters he was paid to write?
SWEETS: Yeah, yeah, look at this one. (he reads) "Your breath gives me life. We're joined by loves tender coil. Sight ruled by my heart alone.
ANGELA: That is very romantic; somebody definitely got their money's worth.
SWEETS: No, I-I don't think it was written for a stranger.
ANGELA: Yeah, but, this is for the customer.
SWEETS: Yeah, look."sight ruled by my heart alone." He was blind. It's about him.
(Daisy enters.)
DAISY: Lance. I heard you were here. I've been calling.
SWEETS: I know. Um, I've busy doing lot of thinking, Daisy.
DAISY: About what? I know something is bothering you. You have to share it with me.
ANGELA: Uh, guys I'm gonna leave.
SWEETS: (to Angela) No, you know what? We should work. (to Daisy) I'll call you. I'll call you.
DAISY: Okay I'll... okay.
(Daisy leaves)
ANGELA: What's going on, Sweets?
SWEETS: You know, I only have one life, Angela and I don't wan to play it safe, so..now I'd really like to work.
ANGELA: Okay. I can check these e-mail headers to see who got this letters. maybe it was some love affair gone wrong. Okay,the server sent the message to this IP address. The remote desktop is open.
SWEETS: Okay, what just happened?
ANGELA: Uh...well, we now have full control over the computer that received these emails.
SWEETS: Whoa, what did you just do?
ANGELA: Turned the web cam on.
SWEETS: Hey, that is the manager at the subway station.
ANGELA: Well, then that is who Martin Aragon sent the love letters to.
(Cut to: Angela's Car - Day. Angela took Daisy out for a drive.)
DAISY: Where are we going?
ANGELA: Uh, Cam asked me get you out of the lab.
DAISY: Why?
ANGELA: Because you keep sighing and moaning.
DAISY: Oh, I thought I was keeping that to myself.
ANGELA: No, no. You were sharing with everyone.
DAISY: Why do you drive a minivan? Do you have kids that we don't know about.
ANGELA: I'm artist, Daisy and the Sienna has plenty of room. Plus, I stink at parallel parking and the back up
camera thing is like the invention of the century. So why are you sighing and moaning, Daisy?
DAISY: Because... Have you ever been dumped?
ANGELA: Of course. Hasn't everybody?
DAISY: Not me.
ANGELA: Never?
DAISY: Never. I'm smart, I'm extremely attractive plus I'm a sexual dynamo.
ANGELA: So, you think that Sweets is going to break up with you?
DAISY: I don't know because it's never happened before. He's pushing me away. He's been avoiding me.
ANGELA: Oh, you don't have anything to worry about.
DAISY: Why?
ANGELA: Because before they break up with you guys usually get really affectionate and sweet.
DAISY: Does it always happen like that?
ANGELA: No. No, not always.
DAISY: So you can't get me any real help at all, even though you've been dumped a lot.
ANGELA: Not a lot.
DAISY: Why would Lance break up with me? I'm awesome.
(Cut to: FBI Headquarters. Booth is talking to Colin Casey)
COLIN: I paid the dude to write letters for me. Is that a crime?
BOOTH: To?
COLIN: Officer McKenna Grant.
BOOTH: Officer Grant,the transit cop that was at the accident?
COLIN: Yeah. I was getting nowhere with her. She was all wrapped up with this dude, Eddie Ceraficki. Aragon said he could appeal to her romantic side.
BOOTH: So you could close the deal.
COLIN: Yeah, she's has cute ass, y'know? I thought maybe that poerty stuff, it could work.
BOOTH: Right, right. You are quite a romantic, Colin. Tell you what, though. Martin Aragon was m*rder.
COLIN: You're kidding me.
BOOTH: Try to look surprised, okay. It'll help.
COLIN: I swear, I had no idea.
BOOTH: You know, maybe when he wrote these letters to her-- Yeah, yeah. That's what it is. You know, maybe when he wrote these letters her, he actually fell in love with her himself?
COLIN: Why would i care? As long as letters worked.
BOOTH: But those letter, they didn't work and you - you shelled out a lot of money for those letters, right? What do you end up with? A blind guy who falls in love with your girliend. That would make you pretty mad, wouldn't it. Am I right, Colin?
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Angela's Office. She's talking to Booth, on the phone, while he is driving.)
ANGELA: I feel uncomfortable talking about this. Is this because of something that that Japanese journalist said?
BOOTH: No, no, no, no. It's just...Riku asked Bones about some of the character stuff in the book and when were alone..Bones, she told me you helped her.
ANGELA: Yeah. I mean, I might have given her a few suggestions. That'all.
BOOTH: Suggestions? Like, um..?
ANGELA: Okay, look, Brennan types up her book and then I go to her place and I lie on the couch, I mean, with a glass of wine,and she reads me the book. I make suggestions.
BOOTH: Um, she reads you the whole book?
ANGELA: Well, yeah. Yeah. And I say..."You know what would be great here? If they were naked. Or um, "What if he says this to her and then they laugh and then they kiss?" You know, that kind of stuff.
BOOTH: The good stuff, you mean.
ANGELA: No, do not do that, Booth. She writes the book. I just drink wine and make suggestions. Like her editor. And editors do not get credit.
BOOTH: How 'bout page 187?
ANGELA: What is it with you guys and page 187? I have to go. I'm busy.
(Cut to: FBI Headquarters - Conference Room. Booth throws down a stack on the table in front of McKenna Grant)
BOOTH: Recognize these?
OFFICER GRANT: Where did you get these?
BOOTH: From the m*rder v*ctim's computer. He wrote them to you, didn't he?
OFFICER GRANT: No. These letters were sent to me by Colin Casey.
BOOTH: No, Colin paid Martin Aragon to write these.
OFFICER GRANT: Well, he wasted his money 'cause I only went out with him a couple times. But you think that maybe Colin blamed the blind guy for not sealing deal? No, sorry but Colin isn't exactly the tough type guy. Eddie may be, not Colin.
BOOTH: Eddie. Your previous boyfriend?
OFFICER GRANT: Yeah, he, um, well, when I left Eddie for Colin, he came down and punched Collin up a little bit. Not hospital punching, but yeah, you know. Knocked him around.
BOOTH: What if Eddie found out that Colin used the blind guy's letters to, uh, woo you away? Where would we find Eddie.
OFFICER GRANT: He owns a pawnshop just above Rock Creek station where I work.
BOOTH: Is that how you met him?
OFFICER GRANT: No, I met Eddie when I arrested him for carrying pizza and w*apon. Yeah, I hear you. I got issues with men. Thanks for update.
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Angela's Office. Hodgins, Daisy, Cam and Angela are reviewing evidence)
HODGINS: This is a Quasar safety slug. It was designed to dissintegrate so it wouldn't riccoshe after it hits its target.
DAISY: So it's safe b*llet?
CAM: Not for the person it hits, just anyone else in the room.
ANGELA: Now, this is a thin clothing of blue colour.
DAISY: That must be what left marks on the clavicle C-7.
CAM: Perhaps 'cause the ammunititon is so rare, we could trace buyers.
HODGINS: We're not done yet. Now, turning our attention to glass fragments embedded in the back of our v*ctim's head.
CAM: The b*llet exited our v*ctim, shattered a glass object behind him before disintegrating.
ANGELA: Right. The angle of applied force was 28 degrees. So if I extend the incidence lines, the point of intersection is here. Which means he was standing between 45 and 60 centimeters in front of the glass object when he was sh*t.
CAM: Okay, then we find that glass and find where he was k*ll.
HODGINS: Well, we're still not done.
(The photographs Daisy took of the rats appear on the screen)
DAISY: Hey! Those are my photographs from when Dr.Hodgins and Is went to find the rat poop.
CAM: Let's not get emotional, Ms. Wick.
HODGINS: Okay, so we need to find glass fixtures that contain borosilicate. We find that here.
ANGELA: Now,I scanned for color frequencs on the wall where the b*llet would have disintegrated. The blue polymer emits about 420 nanomers.
CAM: You found where he was murded.
HODGINS: He was was lured into this tunnel and was sh*t.
DAISY: Let the record show that my photographs were invaluable to the process. There's no record, is there?
(Cut to: Eddie's Pawn Shop. Booth, Brennan are there to talk to Eddie Ceraficki. Riko is still tagging along)
RIKU IWANAGA: This is pawnshop...like the one in your first book when Doctor Reichs and Agent Andy removed their clothes in the two-man submarine.
BRENNAN: The pulverized acromion is the important part of that book.
BOOTH: Yeah, well, you know what, I like the sub.
EDDIE CERAFICKI: I can hardly wait to see what you three are looking for. Oh, come on. You've got to be kidding me.
BOOTH: You own an g*n, Mr. Ceraficki?
EDDIE: Of course I own a g*n. It's a pawnshop. Never had to use it. I mean, I wave it around from time to time, but...
BRENNAN: Why is he allowed to carry a g*n after he was arrested on concealed w*apon charge?
EDDIE: That was a mistake. I accidental put it in my pocket, you know, when left work.
BOOTH: Can we see the g*n, please? It's just right over here.
(Eddie goes to get the g*n out of a bag from back against the wall)
BOOTH: Uh-uh--Real easy there. Don't want any sudden movements. No mistakes. That's it.
RIKU IWANAGA: That is very sexy. Big Andy, with a g*n, protecting Kathy.
BRENNAN: No, no, no. He's not Andy and I'm not Kathy. Plus, it's even more exciting when he sh**t someone with it.
BOOTH: Bones.
BRENNAN: Well, it is, Booth. And very impressive. He never misses.
RIKU IWANAGA: Andy sometimes misses.
BRENNAN: Yes. See?
BOOTH: Sorry about that one, pal.
EDDIE: I get it. Cops gotta be careful.
BOOTH: Is that a box of a*mo over there?
(He takes the top off the box; they're Quasar safety slugs)
BRENNAN: Aha! Gotcha, dirtbag!
EDDIE: Got me for what?
BOOTH: (to Riko) Don't write that.
BRENNAN: What? We got him.
(Cut to: FBI Headquarters - Interrogation Room. Booth is talking with Eddie)
BOOTH: Officer Grant says you have quite a temper.
EDDIE: Yeah. Well. Guy starts writing love letters to your girlfriend, then she dumps you for him? He's gonna get a pop in the nose. It's practically the law, right?
BOOTH: Yeah. Right, so you punch him in the nose, that's fine.
EDDIE: Thank you.
BOOTH: Then you find out that it wasn't Colin Casey who wrote the letters.
EDDIE: What? He admitted it.
BOOTH: No, no, no. He hired someone else to write the letters. You find that out, then you get really pissed off and you sh**t him.
EDDIE: Who?
BOOTH: Martin Aragon. The guy who actually wrote the letters.
EDDIE: Oh, wait, wait. So she dumped me for another guy?
BOOTH: No, she dumped you for Colin.
EDDIE: Alright, now I'm confused.
BOOTH: The point of all of this is that we have your fancy blue b*ll*ts and the g*n and we know where you sh*t him.
EDDIE: I never sh*t my g*n. I told you already. Okay? I might wave it around from time to time if some bad-looking dude comes in my joint,but I never sh*t it. And plus, I-I'm sure you figured out that those blue b*ll*ts don't fit in that g*n.
BOOTH: Guy could have two g*n, right?
EDDIE: Who are you saying I k*ll again?
BOOTH: I'll tell you what, Eddie. If you have nothing to hide, why don't you just show me the g*n that uses these fancy blue b*ll*ts? (he pauses so that Eddie could answer..when he doesn't..) Okay, let the record show that the suspect acted very suspiciously when I asked him to produce the w*apon.
EDDIE: No. Wait! Okay. I gave the g*n to somebody.
BOOTH: Who?
EDDIE: She said I was a stiff sometimes. Alright? Boring, I guess and she wanted me to be a little romantic, so I gave her the g*n that brought us together in the first place.
BOOTH: Officer Grant?
EDDIE: Yeah. Got it engraved and I gave it to her for Valentine's Day. So, now, are you gonna inform the record on what to show on that?
BOOTH: There is no record.
(Cut to: FBI Headquarters - Conference Room. Booth and Brennan are waiting for Officer Grant to arrive. She's brought in by another FBI Agent.)
BOOTH: Officer Grant, thanks for coming in. Can I have your sidearm, please?
OFFICER GRANT: What's this about?
BOOTH: Well, we got a warrant to, uh, search your apartment. Will you have a seat, please? We, uh, found Eddie's g*n. It says,"You can arrest me anytime. Eddie."
BRENNAN: You're a law enforcement professional; why would you keep the m*rder w*apon?
OFFICER GRANT: I am a law enforcement professional and if you had any evidence that wasn't circumstantial, you'd have arrested me. So, I guess I'll be leaving. It's been a pleasure.
BOOTH: Hold on...for one second, please. We also have a warrant for your shoes.
OFFICER GRANT: My shoes? (Brennan holds up an evidence bag.) What's that?
BRENNAN: Leather we found with the v*ctim's tissue. Inside a rat. If we can match this leather to your shoes, it'll show that you were there when the v*ctim died.
BOOTH: Will you please remove your shoes, Officer Grant?
(Booth closes the door and Officer Grant sits down)
OFFICER GRANT: Eddie was a good guy. I just wanted a little romance but those letters were a lie. I should have been happy with Eddie. I should have been happy with what I had.
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Hallway. Brennan is walking Riku Iwanaga out.)
RIKU IWANAGA: Thank you very much. I have a big article to write.
BRENNAN: Well, I hope you would stress important things in my novels.
RIKU IWANAGA: I have learned very much.
BRENNAN: Yes, you learned that rat excrement can provide not only the time line, but also, very important non-circumstantial evidence.
RIKU IWANAGA: I also learned that people should not take credit for what other people write.
BRENNAN: What is that supposed to mean?
RIKU IWANAGA: Uh, I mean the man who was m*rder, of course.
BRENNAN: oh.
RIKU IWANAGA: Arigato.
BRENNAN: Arigato.
(They bow. Riku leaves and Brennan sees Angela working in her office and smiles at her)
(Cut to: FBI Headquarters - Conference Room. Sweets is with Sophia Meade.)
SOPHIA: "Unseen,I feel your spirit as we work. The scent of your hair. The accidental brush of your skin. I hear your heart b*at. Mine b*at with yours as one. "I breathe when you breathe, breath to breath, b*at to b*at..." You believe Martin wrote these letters to me?
SWEETS: Yeah. The imagery, the syntax, the emotion. Yes, I do.
SOPHIA: So you're saying he was in love with me?
SWEETS: I wasn't sure whether to tell you, but... I figured that if I was him, I wouldn't want my fear to prevent you from knowing how I felt.
SOPHIA: But he never said anything..but Martin wouldn't, would he? I was married. I had children. I was happy. He could never have what he wanted. Poor Martin.
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Angela's Office. Brennan enters and hands her an envelope)
ANGELA: What is this?
BRENNAN: It's your share.
ANGELA: My share of what?
BRENNAN: My advance, plus an estimation of what you deserve for the other two books.
ANGELA: Okay, would you stop talking as though I know what you're talking about?
BRENNAN: I've come to realize, over the past couple days, that you deserve twenty-five percent of what I get for my books.
ANGELA: Does this have to do with Hodgins and the whole sex thing on page 187?
BRENNAN: Among other things.
ANGELA: So, is this Booth's idea?
BRENNAN: Uh, no. I did my own math. Booth is terrible at math.
ANGELA: Well, I meant the whole "share" thing.
BRENNAN: Booth's surprise at your involvement caused me to reevaluate our arrangement.
(Brennan goes to leave and Angela opens the envelope. When she pulls out the check and almosts faints. That's a lot of zeros...)
ANGELA: Oooh.
BRENNAN: Is my math incorrect?
ANGELA: Wow..um, this is... this is twenty-five percent?
BRENNAN: Yes. I figure if my agent gets ten percent - you deserve more.
(Cut to: Medico Legal Lab - Bone Room. Daisy is putting bones away.)
SWEETS: Daisy.
DAISY: Lancelot, there you are. Don't touch the bones.
SWEETS: Oh, did it look like I was going to? I wasn't.
DAISY: I've been trying to call you. You've been avoiding me, haven't you?
SWEETS: Yeah. I, uh, I just... I needed to think about some things. About you and-and me and-and what I want my life to be.
DAISY: Is this because of the boy who didn't die of leukemia?
SWEETS: Yeah.
DAISY: And you're here because you decided something?
SWEETS: Yeah.
DAISY: Am I going to like what you decided?
SWEETS: I don't know. I just want to say that I don't want to spend any more time away from you than I have to.
DAISY: What?
SWEETS: I'm doing this wrong. Um, when my mom died, she left me something and my mom and dad were together for almost 60 years.
DAISY: They were really old.
SWEETS: Yeah, they were really old when they adopted me. (He takes a ring box out of his coat pocket and opens it) Um... It's just a modest ring, but it represents 60 years of love. (he gets on one knee) Daisy, will you be my wife?
DAISY: (she gets on her knees and wraps her arms around Sweets) It would make me incredibly happy if you would be my husband. (she kisses him) I'm sorry about everyone else - all the bad things - but that earthquake was the luckiest thing in the world for me.
(They kiss again)
(Cut to: Brennan's Apartment - Night. Brennan opens her door (in a robe), Booth is there.)
BOOTH: You are not going to believe this.
BRENNAN: Come in. You want a drink? I have some Chinese food in the refrigerator.
BOOTH: Uh, a drink. Scotch.
BRENNAN: What am I not going to believe?
BOOTH: Officer Grant got a lawyer.
BRENNAN: Well, we just arrested her for m*rder. I believe that.
BOOTH: Right, Eddie...Eddie got her the best defense attorney in town.
BRENNAN: That is hard to believe.
BOOTH: I know. Right? He heard what she did for him and he fall in love with her all over again.
BRENNAN: That is not rational.
BOOTH: Yeah. You know what? I still can be surprised by people.
BRENNAN: Is that good or bad?
BOOTH: Uh, bad? I think. Uh... I don't know.
BRENNAN: Well, if she's convicted, even with good behavior, she'll be in prison for the next 15 years.
BOOTH: Yeah, but he said that they're soul mates and he'll it for however long it takes for her to get out.
BRENNAN: Soul mates.
BOOTH: Soul mates. Yeah.
BRENNAN: The idea of soul mates actually originated with Plato.
BOOTH: Yeah, you mean the-the clay that kids play with.
BRENNAN: No, the...Oooh. (she laughs)
BOOTH: What?
BRENNAN: You're joking.
BOOTH: Me, joke? No.
BRENNAN: No, the ancient Greek philosopher. His theory was that humans originally consisted of four arms, four legs and two faces. Zeus was threatened by their power and split them all in half, condemning us all to spend our lives trying to complete ourselves.
BOOTH: I don't believe that's true.
BRENNAN: I agree. It's ridiculous.
BOOTH: Right? Four arms. Four heads.
BRENNAN: Two faces.
BOOTH: Come on.
END.
