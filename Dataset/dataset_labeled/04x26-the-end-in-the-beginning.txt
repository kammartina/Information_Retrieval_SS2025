TEASER
(Interior BOOTH and BRENNAN'S APPARTMENT - BEDROOM, 4:47 AM. BOOTH is sleeping)
HODGINS: [narrating] People say you only live once, but are as wrong about that, as they are about everything.
(BRENNAN enters)
HODGINS: [narrating] In the darkest moments before dawn a woman returns to her bed. What life is she leading? Is it the same life the woman was leading half an hour ago? A day ago? A year ago?
(Pan to BOOTH)
HODGINS: [narrating] Who is this man? Do they lead separate lives, or is it a single life shared?
BRENNAN: Do you love me?
BOOTH: Yeah. Do you want me to prove it to you?
BRENNAN: Mmm, if you're not too sleepy...
(BOOTH kisses BRENNAN)
HODGINS: [narrating] A storm approaches. A still over the horizon, but there is lightning in the air. Are either of them aware of the gathering turbulence? Can the feel the crackling of electricity in the wind? Or are they only aware of the power they generate between themselves?
BOOTH: Ooh, I love when you do that.
BRENNAN: [giggles]
(Cut to morning. 5:43 AM.)
HODGINS: [narrating] The first hint of the storm is not a thunderclap. It is a knock.
(There's a knock at the front door)
BRENNAN: Get it!
BOOTH: [groaning] No. You get it!
BRENNAN: No, you get it!
BOOTH: You get it!
(BRENNAN pulls sheet off BOOTH)
BOOTH: [groans]
BRENNAN: [giggles]
BOOTH: Aww! Great, I get it.
(BOOTH answers the door in BRENNAN'S floral bath robe)
BOOTH: What? What?
(CAM and JARED are waiting at the door)
CAM: Morning. I'm Detective Saroyan.
BOOTH: Yeah, I know who you are. You're my brothers' partner.
(CAM flashes her Police badge)
JARED: She prefers the term "boss".
CAM: Official visit. See the badge?
(BRENNAN enters)
BRENNAN: What's going on?
BOOTH: Aah! There's my robe!
CAM: A body was found at your nightclub.
(Cut to: exterior of THE LAB, BOOTH and BRENNAN'S nightclub. BOOTH and BRENNAN pull up in THE ALLEY behind the club in their Mercedes. There are two Police cars also in the alley, as well as a number of Police officers.)
BOOTH: So who was still at work when you left?
BRENNAN: Zack came in just before four. Brought the car around for me. And then Fisher was supposed to come in at five so that they could do an inventory. Do you think it was one of them?
BOOTH: Well, you know, they should have said more than "there's a body".
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE PLATFORM)
ZACK: They found him laying in the bathroom.
BRENNAN: Is it terrible?
FISHER: Uh when Zack saw it he, he screamed. I heard him from the kitchen.
ZACK: Yelped, not screamed.
(CAM enters)
CAM: Ready?
(BRENNAN leaves)
ZACK: I was taken aback!
FISHER: Yeah, it was a scream.
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE TOILETS. A foot is visible from one of the cubicles.)
HODGINS: [narrating] She has never seen a dead body before.
(CAM, BOOTH and BRENNAN enter)
HODGINS: [narrating] He was in the Army and has seen too many.
(CAM opens cubicle door to reveal a man sh*t in the chest.)
JARED: Recognise him?
BRENNAN: No.
(BOOTH and CAM exchange glances.)
JARED: You didn't see this guy last night?
BRENNAN: No.
BOOTH: Neither one of us was in the floor much last night.
JARED: What about this?
(JARED crouched and pokes a matchbox on the floor near the deceased's foot)
JARED: You ever hear of a place called, uh, "Amicangelo's"?
BRENNAN: [shakes head] uh uh.
CAM: Which one's closer to the washroom, your office, or the kitchen?
BRENNAN: My office.
CAM: How is it that the chef heard your assistant shout, but you didn't hear a g*n?
BRENNAN: Maybe I'd already gone home, I left at 4am.
JARED: But coagulation suggests that time of death occurred between 1 and 3am.
CAM: Obviously you weren't where you said you were, so where were you?
BRENNAN: From midnight until 4am I was in my office, then I went home.
BOOTH: Let's go Honey. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
(BRENNAN and BOOTH leave)
CAM: You think that was insensitive?
JARED: I dunno, implying that she was cheating on her husband maybe could've waited until he wasn't standing right next to her.
CAM: Why? They bust up and you finally get a crack at her. It's what you want, right?
(CAM leaves)
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE BAR)
CAROLINE: I know you all worked late last night. Maybe short on sleep, but I need to prepare you for what happens next. Anybody not heard about our m*rder?
(Pan to WENDELL, DAISY, ANGELA, VINCENT, SWEETS AND FISHER, all shaking their heads)
CAROLINE: Good, 'cos you are all suspects.
(CAM enters, followed by the deceased being wheeled away on a gurney)
CAM: Somebody turned off the security cameras.
SWEETS: You think one of us is the k*ll?
CAROLINE: You mind, Detective Saroyan, I am conferring with my clients.
(CAM rolls her eyes and leaves)
VINCENT NIGEL-MURRAY: Are you in fact acting as our solicitor in this matter?
CAROLINE: I am the nightclub's lawyer. You are welcome to call up your own.
ANGELA: Well if we didn't do it, why do we need a lawyer?
DAISY: I didn't k*ll anyone!
WENDELL: Zack screamed when he saw the body, so he's off the hook, right?
ZACK: Yelped!
FISHER: He screamed like Slutty Girl #1 in a teen horror flick.
CAROLINE: From here on in you do not answer questions you don't get asked!
(Cut to: interior THE HOMICIDE DIVISION - THE INTERVIEW ROOM. FISHER is being questioned by CAM and JARED, CAROLINE is present as his attorney.)
FISHER: Consider me your top suspect, CAROLINE: Oh for God's sake!
FISHER: I'm a trained chef, alright. Finest schools in Europe. But my professional life consists of cooking chicken wings designed to make people drink more beer. I'm a man on the edge.
(JARED throws a file of Crime Scene photos to FISHER)
CAM: Your wings have been voted best in the city two years running.
FISHER: Not best. Tallest. I'm the originator of the "Tower of Wings", which'll probably be on my tombstone.
(FISHER looks at a Crime Scene photo of the deceased)
FISHER: Never seen him before in my life.
CAM: You're the hostess, you see everyone who comes in.
(Cut to ANGELA)
ANGELA: Uh maybe if you had a picture of him alive, I don't have a very visual imagination.
(Cut to DAISY)
DAISY: He looks like a lot of guys. Is that his real hair?
(Cut to WENDELL)
WENDELL: [shakes head]
CAROLINE: Let the record show that my client is indicating with his head that he does not recognise the v*ctim, like all my clients. Next question.
CAM: Have you witnessed any... altercations, any differences of opinion at the club lately?
(Cut to ANGELA)
ANGELA: Well, Mr. B, I mean, that's what we all call Mr. Booth, told this hip-hop impresario, "C-Sync", who is actually very cute, by the way, that he would never book him, or any of his acts into the club.
(Cut to VINCENT)
VINCENT: C-Sync, yeah, he's alright, inn'e. He's right hand full of talent, left hand full of street cred, due to the fact that his brother's a big time gangsta.
JARED: Clark Edison, aka C-Sync, you restrained him from lunging at your boss?
(Cut to WENDELL)
WENDELL: [squints at JARED]
(Cut to CAM and CAROLINE looking at each other quizzically, then back at WENDELL)
(Cut to DAISY)
DAISY: I heard C-Sync shouting all the way at the back of the coat check. He was mad.
JARED: You're aware of a city councilman named Max Keenan?
(Cut to SWEETS)
SWEETS: Everybody knows Max. He's around all the time. Max Keenan is upset because he never got his "facilitators fee" for getting city council to re-zone us for live entertainment.
CAM: Why would crooked politician tell you about not getting a pay off?
SWEETS: I'm a bartender, I'm practically a phycologist.
(Cut to CAM looking exasperated)
ZACK: A Persian named Ara Something wants to buy the nightclub JARED: Arastoo Vaziri?
ZACK: Bren's met with him about forty times. Mr. B does not want to sell.
(Cut to DAISY)
DAISY: It was me who shut off the security cameras. I wanted some privacy with my boyfriend, whom I will not name.
(Cut to FISHER)
FISHER: OK, me and Daisy, look we have a thing. But the thing that we have isn't, you know, isn't a boyfriend-girlfriend thing. It's a thing. It's just not a thing.
(Cut to ANGELA)
ANGELA: Miss Julian warned us that you have to make an arrest in this case, and I just wanna say that just because Jared Booth and I went out on a couple of dates, and he cannot accept the fact that it is going no where, does not mean that I should go to gaol.
JARED: Didn't your lawyer tell you not to answer any questions you weren't asked?
CAM: Should I mark your people down as "stupid" or "uncooperative"?
CAROLINE: Put 'em down as "well represented".
CAM: How about I put 'em down as "accessories after the fact"?
(Cut to: Interior THE ROYAL DINER. BRENNAN and BOOTH are at the counter eating.)
BRENNAN: How long will the club be shut down?
BOOTH: Oh, well, as long as they want, it's a m*rder scene.
BRENNAN: Financially that's gonna hurt.
(MAX enters)
MAX: I'm your councilman, maybe I can help.
BOOTH: [laughs] What's that going to set us back?
MAX: I want you to consider the possibility that this unfortunate incident, BRENNAN: You mean the homicide.
MAX: Maybe if you had remembered to reimburse the people that went out of their way to get you that zoning change, BOOTH: Ok, really, what're you gonna do, put the squeeze on us retractably?
MAX: Why's it so hard for your husband to see the ways of the world?
BRENNAN: Because he wants me to be proud of him.
(Cut to: interior THE HOMICIDE DIVISON - OFFICES)
CAM: I'm afraid you won't be able to reopen the nightclub for quite some time, BRENNAN: Well, where can I appeal that decision?
CAM: Wow, what they said about you was true!
BRENNAN: What's that?
CAM: That you're kind of a cold fish.
BRENNAN: Well if by cold fish you mean pragmatic and rational, then that's what I am.
CAM: No I meant more like somebody when a human being is m*rder cares more about reopening the club than capturing the m*rder.
BRENNAN: Well, I have my job, and you have yours.
(CAM and BRENNAN enter CAM'S OFFICE)
CAM: Where were you really last night? Who were you with?
BRENNAN: I had a very satisfying go-around with my husband at about 5 this morning, how about you?
CAM: The v*ctim was k*ll by a g*n wound to the chest. g*n are loud, but you did not hear it. You were not in the building. Either we talk about this now, maybe it goes no further, or otherwise I've gotta pursue this line of enquiry in a graceless manner.
BRENNAN: So this is blackmail.
CAM: You pride yourself on being pragmatic, I figured you'd appreciate the logic.
(Cut to: interior THE HOMICIDE DIVISION - THE STAFF ROOM. JARED is getting a cup of coffee while BOOTH leans on the door jamb)
JARED: This guy, the Persian, or whatever, how bad does he want your place?
BOOTH: Who? Viziri? He's the kinda guy who won't take no for an answer. Why?
JARED: Because the guy comes up shady. But he's got an alibi for last night. Twin hooker alibis. Now I'm gonna tell you something Cam doesn't even know yet. Coroner's found fibres inside the b*llet track, from something used to muffle the g*n.
BOOTH: Well that'd explain why Bren didn't hear the sh*t.
JARED: Yeah, well, it's amazing what forensics can do these days. Now, if we happen to find that particular item, it could lead straight to the k*ll.
BOOTH: So you think I know where it is?
JARED: I'm just saying the best thing is that item never shows up.
(JARED exits)
(Cut to: interior BOOTH'S CAR)
BRENNAN: Cam says everybody thinks I'm a cold fish.
BOOTH: Nah, what you are is Iceland. Cold to the touch, but underneath you're all volcano.
BRENNAN: (giggles) I don't like people thinking that I'm a cold fish.
BOOTH: Look if you were really a cold fish, you wouldn't care.
BRENNAN: You used logic on me. That's sweet. (rubs BOOTH'S neck)
BOOTH: (laughs)
BRENNAN: Cam says the reason I didn't hear the g*n is because I'm cheating on you.
BOOTH: Oh well, Jared thinks I'm, you know, the k*ll, and he's helping me get away with it, BRENNAN: So you're a m*rder, I'm unfaithful... we are a very exciting couple.
BOOTH: Except the real reason you didn't hear anything is because the g*n was muffled.
(BOOTH'S phone rings)
BOOTH: That's Caroline's phone. What's she calling for?
(BOOTH answers the phone)
BOOTH: Hello, you've reached Bonnie and Clyde, BRENNAN: m*rder Incorporated ,
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE BAR. CAROLINE is on her cell phone)
BOOTH AND BRENNAN: (over the phone) How may we help you?
MAX: Yeah, it's Max,
(Cut back to: BOOTH'S CAR)
BOOTH: Max, what're you doing on Caroline's phone?
(Cut back to THE LAB)
MAX: I don't own a cell phone. Big Brother always knows where you are when you've got a cell phone.
CAROLINE: I guess when you're as shifty as Max here, paranoid is good.
MAX: You're open for business tonight.
(Cut to BOOTH'S car)
BRENNAN: Well how'd you pull that off?
CAROLINE: (over the phone) Let's say....
(Cut to: THE LAB)
CAROLINE: I went in the front door, Max slipped in the back, and we got it covered.
(Cut to: BOOTH'S car)
BOOTH: What does that even mean?
MAX: (over the phone) It just means that you've gotta remember
(Cut to: THE LAB)
MAX: what they say about one hand washing the other.
(CAROLINE hangs up phone)
CAROLINE: That particular cliché pertains to people with clean hands, Max. You do not qualify.
(CAROLINE exits, camera focuses on WENDELL who is standing near the PLATFORM)
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE CATWALK. VINCENT moving boxes of his DJ equipment around, ZACK is watching him)
ZACK: There's a bl*od stain on the bathroom wall, VINCENT: Yeah, someone smashed the v*ctim's head against the wall, knocked him out, then came back and finished him off with a sh*t to the chest. A very cold-blooded execution, in fact.
ZACK: How did you know that?
VINCENT: I eavesdropped on the cops. Also, they're looking for something that was used to smother the sound of the sh*t.
(VINCENT removes a panel from one of his equipment boxes, revealing a g*n atop his DJ gear)
ZACK: (moves over to the equipment box and removes the g*n) Why do you have a g*n?
VINCENT: (startled) Ooh! I'm English, alright. We don't use g*n. We use our foreheads. What you've most likely picked up is the m*rder w*apon.
ZACK: (replaces g*n in the equipment box) Why would the m*rder hide the g*n in your stuff?
VINCENT: Perhaps because the m*rder sussed me out as, you know, the type of fellow who'd be smart enough to get rid of it. Evidently he didn't expect you to be here when I discovered it.
ZACK: You mean we should get rid of it?
VINCENT: You and I are not in collusion.
ZACK: Why not?
VINCENT: Because you're the type of moron who goes to gaol for a m*rder he didn't commit, and I am not.
ZACK: Then, whatta we do?
VINCENT: OK, what I should do is k*ll you with the g*n, and then tell the cops that you attacked me after confessing to the m*rder. (holds up hand for a high-five)
ZACK: (looks uncertainly at VINCENT)
(Cut to: exterior THE LAB)
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE BAR. SWEETS is behind THE BAR, while HODGINS sits at THE BAR)
SWEETS: It's hard to believe that someone was m*rder just over there.
HODGINS: Means nothing to me, a best selling pulp crap crime novelist. I trade in death daily. (takes a sip from his drink) Theoretically. What liquor best exemplifies death by substance abuse?
(SWEETS shrugs)
HODGINS: Irish Whisky? (puts on an Irish accent) 'Course, but which spirit best represents m*rder most foul?
SWEETS: You know, everyone who works here is a suspect? I'm working with the m*rder.
HODGINS: (with Irish accent) Do you have a picture of the poor bastard who was m*rder?
(SWEETS reached under the bar for his phone)
SWEETS: Fisher sent this to me this morning before the cops arrived.
HODGINS: Ooh! (leans forward to grab the phone)
SWEETS: (hold phone to his chest) I'll only show you if you lose the Irish accent.
HODGINS: (holds up his hands to say OK)
SWEETS: Take a look (gives HODGINS the phone)
HODGINS: (looks at the photo on the cell phone) This may was obviously a hired k*ll.
SWEETS: You get that from a phone pic?
HODGINS: His hair, his suit, his ring. The fact that I talked to him last night. Here.
SWEETS: (shocked) You? Here? In this bar? I didn't see him.
HODGINS: (disbelieving) Gottcha. Yeah, right, none of us did. Very good. m*rder most foul.
(Cut to: interior THE LAB- THE PLATFORM. CLARK walking up onto THE PLATFORM, followed by BOOTH, BRENNAN and CAROLINE)
CLARK: Can you feel that? I mean this place is magic! Your stage has mystic properties (kisses his fingers)
BRENNAN: That is a ridiculous urban legend.
CLARK: Then explain to me how so many of the people who've played here over the years have gone on to fame and fortune?
BOOTH: Maybe it's because we have good taste.
CLARK: This place had the power before you got here, and'll have it after you're gone. All I want is my piece of the legacy. (Spins around) C-Sync baby! And if you had good taste, you would book me first, and then each of my protégés thereafter, ya dig?
BOOTH: Well, dig this. I recognise you're personal talent, but we won't book you or you're... BRENNAN: Protégés, BOOTH: Because of your bro-tha CLARK: So, you're just brazenly r*cist.
CAROLINE: This is exactly where I did not want this conversation to go.
BRENNAN: My husband is concerned about your gang ties. Which is not you, but is your brother.
CLARK: Look, there's Kane, and then there's Able. Do you see a mark on my forehead? Nah. So that makes me Able. And on top of that, how're you gonna penalise my protégés because of my brother? How is that fair?
CAROLINE: (to BOOTH) As your lawyer I must advise you, if Mr. Edison lodges a suit, CLARK: (mouths "lawsuit" at BOOTH)
CAROLINE: the outcome is not assured in our favour.
BRENNAN: We will discuss it. Since we are partners.
(VINCENT enters)
VINCENT: Hi hi. Listen, I know whatever you're doing is very important but, C-Sync? C-Sync!
CLARK: Hey!
VINCENT: Wasswah!
CLARK: Be glad you're a pasty white albino, Vinny.
VINCENT: Cheers. Uh, I need to talk.
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE CATWALK. VINCENT'S equipment boxes. BOOTH looks at the g*n sitting on top of the DJ gear)
BOOTH: Wooo, oh no.
VINCENT: 200 million unregistered g*n in the country, this one finds its way into my gear.
BOOTH: Anybody touch it?
(Pan to ZACK who raises his hand)
(Cut to CAROLINE looking at the g*n on the DJ gear)
CAROLINE: Did anybody touch it?
BOOTH: Zack did.
CAROLINE: (sighs)
VINCENT: Legally, it's with my stuff, can I, like claim it as my own and toss it into a volcano?
BRENNAN: Caroline is an officer of the court. She has to report it. Right?
CAROLINE: I sure as hell do now!
(Cut to BOOTH and BRENNAN looking at the g*n in the DJ gear)
BOOTH: 38, right? Matches the m*rder w*apon.
BRENNAN: Zack touched it.
(CAM enters, looking at the g*n in the DJ gear)
CAM: Will you two let me do some of the detecting, please? (picks up g*n with her pen) Saturday Night Special. Totally disposable.
(Pan to HODGINS, leaning on the railing of THE CATWALK)
HODGINS: My theory, it's the m*rder v*ctim g*n. Taken away from him by persons unknown, who sh*t him in the chest then hid it here, thinking that Vincent would find it, panic, and throw it away because he's, well, English.
CAM: Who is this now?
CAROLINE: Jack Hodgins, very successful crime novelist.
CAM: They never get anything right.
VINCENT: I'm not going to fair well in gaol. I'm lovely.
BOOTH: Don't worry Vincent, I'll bail you out.
BRENNAN: (clears throat and puts her hand on BOOTH'S shoulder)
BOOTH: You too, Zack.
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE BAR VINCENT is handcuffed and being led out of THE LAB by CAM)
HODGINS: No Vincent, no DJ. No DJ, no entertainment. You carpe your diem, bub.
SWEETS: (serves HODGINS a drink) You mean the band?
HODGINS: Get the girl to smack the tambourine, and maybe you've got a sh*t.
SWEETS: You mean Angela?
HODGINS: Of course I don't mean Angela. You don't stand a chance with Angela. Her. (motions towards DAISY) Pansy, or Buttercup... SWEETS: Daisy?
(ARASTOO enters)
HODGINS: The mysterious Persian real-estate mogul who's been trying to buy our home away from home. What various reasons does he have?
ARASTOO: I want this club because I know how to turn it into a gold mine.
HODGINS: Boring.
ARASTOO: Good business, like a good marriage, is outwardly boring.
HODGINS: (looks at ARASTOO incredulously)
ARISTOO: Sorry.
(Cut to: exterior THE LAB - THE ALLEY. BOOTH is sitting on the bonnet of his car while WENDELL talks to him from the back door of THE LAB)
WENDELL: So, I go home a little before 3. Check to make sure that Bren has locked up the safe. I wonder, did somebody taped the door after I checked it? 'Cos this guy got in somehow.
BOOTH: The dead guy, or, uh, whoever k*ll him.
(WENDELL crouches down and fiddles with the lock of the door)
WENDELL: There's nothing tacky on the bolt here, so it's wasn't taped. That means that either the dead guy hid in the club after closing, or Bren let him in after my sweep.
BOOTH: Nah, she didn't.
WENDELL: Whoever k*ll this guy had a key or was also already in the club.
BOOTH: Bren wasn't the only one inside the club.
(WENDELL and BOOTH exchange glances)
BOOTH: You seem pretty sure this is the way it played out.
(WENDELL shifts)
WENDELL: The dead guy, chats me up last night.
BOOTH: (shocked) OK, why didn't you tell the police?
WENDELL: Creepy old guy trespassing around our club during the night. I know what I'd do if I caught him.
BOOTH: (pauses) Did you catch him?
WENDELL: (pauses) Nope, did you? 'Cos until I get the specific answer to that question, my loyalty is with you.
BOOTH: I didn't catch him, but I appreciate your loyalty.
WENDELL: (nods his head, holds a finger to is mouth to say he'll keep quiet and b*at his fist over his heart)
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE BAR)
(FISHER enters carrying a "Tower of Wings")
(Pan to BOOTH entering, carrying a carton of wine. BRENNAN and ARASTOO are talking at THE BAR)
BOOTH: Hey Arastoo, how you doing?
BRENNAN: He's making me another offer on the nightclub.
BOOTH: How big of a bump do we get for m*rder?
BRENNAN: The offer is lower.
ARISTOO: The place is under a cloud. Things like this occur when people are not reasonable.
BOOTH: Implying that you're behind the m*rder, trying to scare me to sell. Ballsy move, pal.
ARASTOO: Behind it? No, merely taking advantage. It's good business.
BOOTH: Right, well, my club's not for sale, but my booze is. So either get a drink or get the hell out of here.
(BRENNAN and ARASTOO exchange glances)
(SWEETS enters)
SWEETS: Hey, Booth, Bren, heard about Vincent being arrested. Can my band audition?
BRENNAN: No.
BOOTH: (imploringly) C'mon, what's the harm? Be ready in one hour, pal.
SWEETS: (pumps fists in the air) Yes! You won't be disappointed.
(SWEETS exits)
BRENNAN: (to BOOTH) Why?
BOOTH: I've got a soft spot for the kid.
BRENNAN: We are made of soft spots. You're still gonna make the call, right?
BOOTH: Of course I'm gonna make the call, I'm not soft in the head.
ARASTOO: What is "the call"?
BOOTH: It's why I own this place, and you never will. OK? So, drink? Or are you gonna leave?
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - BRENNAN'S OFFICE BRENNAN enters BRENNAN'S OFFICE, ANGELA runs in behind her)
ANGELA: Hey! Awkward, very awkward. Awkward.
BRENNAN: Angela, what is awkward?
(ANGELA takes a folded up napkin from her pocket and gives it to BRENNAN)
BRENNAN: It's a floor plan, for the nightclub.
ANGELA: Yeah, I drew it. For the m*rder v*ctim, last night. (moves over to BRENNAN'S couch) You know how what I really wanted to do was interior decorating, right? I mean, I'm very good, I sort of have a knack. (picks up a cushion from BRENNAN'S couch and ruffles it) And he told me that he owned a nightclub, and that he'd hire me to... and I figured that he was probably hitting on me, but then Jared showed up and asked me out for, like, the hundredth time, BRENNAN: Why are you showing this to me?
ANGELA: Because if I show it to Mr. B, his head will explode. You're a cooler customer.
BRENNAN: I'm not a cold fish, I'm Iceland.
ANGELA: (scoffs) OK, If I had a better grasp of geography I might know what you mean.
BRENNAN: Why would his head explode?
ANGELA: Well, note the X. At this office. Traditionally, X marks the spot.
BRENNAN: The safe? You think he wanted to rob us?
ANGELA: Well, yeah, maybe, or it's possible that the X marks a whole other objective. The only thing left is... BRENNAN: Me.
ANGELA: (impersonates BOOTH'S head exploding)
(Cut to: interior THE ROYAL DINER. BRENNAN is meeting with MAX)
BRENNAN: (slides the napkin with the floor plan that ANGELA drew to MAX)
MAX: Why didn't you show this to the police?
BRENNAN: Because they'll take it without telling me what it means.
MAX: What do you think it means?
BRENNAN: People know the best way to hurt him, MAX: Is to hurt you.
BRENNAN: (nods)
MAX: The Persians are capable of sending a very bad message.
BRENNAN: What do you mean, "bad message"?(puts the napkin back in her bag)
MAX: Head cracking, leg breaking, neck snapping, finger snipping.
Like that. It's possible they sent this guy...
BRENNAN: To break my legs?
MAX: And the gang-bangers make him, and they k*ll him to make a statement.
BRENNAN: (pauses) So Booth was right about the gang-bangers?
MAX: Everyone serves somebody. Something you husband refuses to accept.
BRENNAN: I know he's stubborn.
MAX: He's a man of principle, and I mean that as a terrible insult. Now, if he had just paid me off, none of this would have happened.
BRENNAN: Who do you work for that could scare of the Persians and the gang-bangers?
MAX: Ask your brother-in-law about the Gravedigger.
BRENNAN: Because he's a cop?
MAX: Because he and I work for the same guy.
(BRENNAN'S phone rings)
BRENNAN: (answers the phone) Hello?

(Cut to: interior THE HOMICIDE DIVISTION - THE CONFERENCE ROOM. CAM has a file in front of her, CAROLINE is seated next to her, BRENNAN and BOOTH are opposite and JARED is standing behind)
CAM: The m*rder v*ctim's been identified as Dick Worstenbach,
(CAM slides the file over to BOOTH)
JARED: He was a security officer for a waste disposal company in Newark.
CAROLINE: (laughs) A mobster named "Worstenbach", what's the world coming to?
BOOTH: So what was he doing at our place?
JARED: That's a mighty fine question.
(JARED and BOOTH eye each other off)
(BRENNAN removes the napkin with the floor plan of THE LAB from her handbag and slides it over to CAM)
CAM: Where did you get this?
BOOTH: What's that?
BRENNAN: It was slipped to me anonymously by somebody who drew it for Worstenbach last night.
JARED: Your office is marked.
CAM: Which means that Worstenbach was in your club last night, but nobody saw him.
(BOOTH leans forward from his chair)
BOOTH: Excuse me Cam, but this proves that Worstenbach was sent to hurt my wife.
CAM: That is one of out theories, yes.
BRENNAN: Could the Gravedigger have sent Worstenbach?
JARED: Now where did you dig that up?
CAROLINE: Isn't he some old mobster type; has his finger in every pie?
JARED: There's no Gravedigger.
CAM: Max likes to say he works for the Gravedigger, makes him scary.
JARED: Exactly, so forget the Gravedigger.
(CAROLINE pouts and rolls her eyes)
CAM: Our first job is to find out who k*ll Worstenbach, finding out who sent him is totally secondary.
BOOTH: Right, but here in the real world, when do we get our DJ back?
CAM: Never.
(BOOTH sighs and rolls his eyes)
CAM: You people are lying to me, and until I find out why you can't have your DJ, (to BRENNAN) nor your assistant, nor anybody else I can scoop up.
CAROLINE: Now, now, it's blatant police brutality to use the word "nor" so aggressively!
(Cut to: interior BOOTH'S CAR)
HODGINS: [narrating] Violent death. m*rder. It sends out shockwaves. The closer you are to it, the greater the shock.
BRENNAN: Max told me that he works for the Gravedigger.
BOOTH: (snorts)
BRENNAN: He told me something else. He said that Jared works for him too.
BOOTH: (hits steering wheel)
BRENNAN: Don't get so mad! Max could be lying.
BOOTH: Look I'm mad because I don't find it hard to believe at all! Alright? Did Max give you the napkin?
BRENNAN: No. Angela.
(BOOTH looks at BRENNAN quizzically)
BRENNAN: What?
BOOTH: What? What do you mean "what"? Why're all of our employees holding out on the cops?
BRENNAN: They love us. Especially you.
BOOTH: They love us. We're loveable. So, OK, what math gets them to obstruct justice?
BRENNAN: They all know that you'd k*ll anyone who was going to hurt me, and that man, Worstenbach, was going to hurt me.
BOOTH: They think I'm the k*ll.
BRENNAN: That's the math that gets them to lying to police and obstructing justice.
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE PLATFORM. SWEETS and his band "GORMOGON" are auditioning to become the new entertainment for the club, DAISY is accompanying on the tambourine)
SWEETS: Hey, so, uh, we're Gormogon, um, I mean, the name of the band is Gormogon. Some people think that I'm Gormogon, but I'm not, it's like how there's no-one named "Floyd" in Pink Floyd... BOOTH: Just play, Sweets.
SWEETS: Yeah, ok...
(SWEETS begins to play the intro on keyboard)
BRENNAN: "Gormogon" is a stupid name. What does it even mean?
(GORMOGON perform the song "Never ending Summer")
(Pan to WENDELL, FISHER, ANGELA and HODGINS sitting at THE BAR watching Gormogon performing)
ANGELA: (to HODGINS) Man, I'm telling you, I'm looking at Sweets in a totally different way!
HODGINS: Really?
(CLARK enters, looks down his nose at GORMOGON, rolls his eyes and walks away)
(GORMOGON finish playing, everybody claps unenthusiastically except for ANGELA, BRENNAN and DAISY)
ANGELA: Whoo hoo!
SWEETS: Thank you!
BRENNAN: That was wonderful. (to BOOTH) That was wonderful.
(Pan to FISHER sitting at THE BAR drinking)
FISHER: Why did they even invent piano?
(Pan to THE PLATFORM)
BOOTH: You see it's, uh, it's, uh, a nightclub, and people they gotta, they gotta dance, not just... DAISY: Fall in love.
SWEETS: (laughs nervously)
(Pan to FISHER at THE BAR looking exasperated)
DAISY: (voice-over) You're really good.
SWEETS: (voice-over) Oh, stop,
(Pan to THE PLATFORM, BOOTH is being joined by CLARK)
BOOTH: Uh, it was great stuff, though. But people, they gotta, uh, they gotta... it's a dance club, big, big noise. You understand.
SWEETS: Alright.
CLARK: (to BOOTH) Hey, my brother would like to talk to you, he's waiting out back.
BOOTH: Right,
(Pan to WENDELL watching the conversation between BOOTH and CLARK looking concerned)
BOOTH: (voice-over) uh Sweets why don't you play another song for the girl, there.
(BOOTH leaves THE PLATFORM, leaving BRENNAN)
BRENNAN: (sighs happily at GORMOGON)
(Pan to BOOTH leaving THE BAR, he is closely followed by WENDELL. FISHER is still sitting at the bar looking frustrated)
(GORMOGON begin to play another ballad)
FISHER: (exasperated) Oh c'mon!
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE BACK OF THE LAB. BOOTH opening the door out onto THE ALLEY)
WENDELL: What's going on, boss.
BOOTH: Oh, I've got a meeting with an angry gang-banger in the alley. Why?
WENDELL: I've got my g*n.
BOOTH: You've got a g*n?
WENDELL: (checks the magazine of his g*n) He's the leader of a gang. He's k*ll people. And, he hates your guts. I ain't a mathematician, but that adds up bad.
BOOTH: Alright, hang back.
WENDELL: Alright.
(BOOTH goes through the back door and into THE ALLEY, locking WENDELL inside THE LAB)
(WENDELL is surprised to see the door slam in his face, and presses down on the handle to try and open the door)
WENDELL: Whaa?
(WENDELL turns to go back into THE LAB)
GRAYSON: (voice-over) I want my brother to play in the club!
(BOOTH is then thrown by GRAYSON into the door, and is then heard to be bashed)
WENDELL: Open the door, Boss! I'm right here! C'mon...
(BOOTH is thrown against the door again. WENDELL is taken aback)
(Sounds of a vicious fight come from THE ALLEY)
WENDELL: I'm coming!
(Cut to THE PLATFORM. GORMOGON is still performing. BRENNAN is watching. WENDELL comes running in and whispers in BRENNAN'S ear before they both turn and run)
(Cut to THE ALLEY, WENDELL and BRENNAN come around the corner to find both BOOTH and GRAYSON sitting on the back of a delivery truck)
BRENNAN: (voice-over) Who is that?
WENDELL: (voice-over) C-Sync's brother. Head of the gang-bangers.
(WENDELL cocks his g*n and aims it at GRAYSON)
WENDELL: Don't move, or I'll blow your head off.
(JARED and CAM enter. JARED cocks his g*n and aims it at WENDELL'S head)
JARED: You wanna drop that?
(WENDELL uncocks his g*n and hands it to JARED)
JARED: Thank you.
(Pan to BOOTH who is bleeding from a gash to his left eyebrow)
BOOTH: Hi Honey!
BRENNAN: Hey, you OK?
BOOTH: Yeah. You should see the other guy.
(Pan to GRAYSON who is clearly unharmed)
JARED: (to CAM) So who do you wanna arrest?
CAM: (sighs) Let's take 'em all.
(Cut to: interior THE HOMICIDE DIVISION - THE INTERROGATION ROOM. BOOTH and GRAYSON are seated next to each other, both handcuffed to their chairs)
GRAYSON: Look Man, my brother don't sag, slag or bang.
BOOTH: What about you?
GRAYSON: (scoffs) Man, Clark barely talks to me, ya dig?
BOOTH: Why do you care?
GRAYSON: He's my brother. And, your club is on my block. Do the math, Man.
BOOTH: Look, I've been here before, OK. The place becomes a gang hangout, East Coast meets West Coast, somebody gets popped.
GRAYSON: Says the dude with a dead body in his bathroom.
BOOTH: Yeah, for all I know, you did it!
GRAYSON: I pop somebody; I don't muffle the sh*t, brother,
(Pan to CAM and JARED watching the conversation behind the one-way mirror.)
GRAYSON: (voice-over) I sh**t him right up in his face. Ask anybody. Look, Man, what if I decree your place off limits to my crew or any other crew?
(Pan to BOOTH)
BOOTH: You can decree?
GRAYSON: He's my brother, Man. I wanna see him get his cheese, see his face on buses.
BOOTH: (chuckles) Fine. C-Sync in da house.
(BOOTH and GRAYSON go to shake hands, but their hands are handcuffed to the seat. They bump fists in agreement instead)
(Pan to CAM and JARED behind the one-way mirror)
JARED: You still think it could be him?
CAM: Nope, he'd of taken credit if he did it, used it to scare your brother. This guy's got nothing to do with Worstenbach's m*rder. Let 'em go.
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE BAR. BRENNAN, BOOTH and ANGELA are having a conversation)
BOOTH: (to BARMAN) Thanks BRENNAN: Now they have my assistant, our doorman and our DJ... ANGELA: Well, I can watch the door until they release WENDELL.
BRENNAN: What about entertainment?
ANGELA: I thought that Sweets was fantabulisticulious.
BOOTH: Uh, we got "The Crue".
ANGELA: What crew?
(SWEETS and DAISY enter. SWEETS' face is covered with lipstick marks, and DAISY is wiping her mouth)
SWEETS: Hey, uh, so Daisy told me something, and I figured you need to know.
DAISY: That m*rder guy? I sorta had a conversation with him... BRENNAN: And you didn't tell the police?
SWEETS: Well, it's what they discussed that's important.
ANGELA: It's Daisy, so they discussed sex.
DAISY: That's mostly true.
BRENNAN: OK, please, what is the point?
DAISY: Well, Lance's songs were so romantic, which made me amorous... SWEETS: Oh, maybe skip ahead a little bit, DAISY: Oh, well, Lance was afraid we'd get caught because I am not abashed about noise, BRENNAN: OK is it skip, ahead or point that she doesn't understand?
DAISY: Well, I told Lance that I knew a place where a couple in love could find some privacy.
(BRENNAN looks at DAISY imploringly)
DAISY: Oh! Which is what I also told Worstenbach.
SWEETS: Yeah, and that's the point.
(Cut to THE LOST AND FOUND, DAISY, BRENNAN and BOOTH are all present)
DAISY: When Wendell does his sweep, he never checks the lost and found.
BOOTH: Worstenbach could've hid back here,
(Pan to BRENNAN crouching over to pick up a match)
BOOTH: (voice-over) and waited for the club to be empty.
BRENNAN: Remember all those wooden matches around the body? (holds up the match to BOOTH)
BOOTH: He was here!
BRENNAN: (to DAISY) Why didn't you tell the police you saw Wostenbach?
DAISY: Fisher says that Mr. B probably k*ll the guy to save you, and that we should do everything we could to impede the investigation. Was that wrong? It felt right.
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - BRENNAN'S OFFICE. ZACK is lying on BRENNAN'S couch without any shoes on)
(BRENNAN enters, and is shocked to find ZACK on her couch)
BRENNAN: What? They let you out!
ZACK: Yes. Someone stole my shoes.
BRENNAN: (chuckles) Of course they did.
ZACK: Sweets found your coat.
BRENNAN: I don't get the connection.
ZACK: It was jammed into a case of premium gin. He brought it to me. I found the b*llet hole.
BRENNAN: Someone used my coat to muffle the g*n.
ZACK: (nods)
BRENNAN: Well, what'd you do with my coat?
(Cut to THE STORAGE ROOM, SWEETS and ZACK are moving boxes to show BRENNAN where they've disposed of her coat)
BRENNAN: (looks into a bucket and sees the charred remains of her coat) That's my expensive Belgian Corduroy coat?
SWEETS: I decided to douse with pure grade alcohol and burn it.
BRENNAN: So you two conspired to keep this big secret from the rest of us.
SWEETS: Mr. B had the strength to smash the guy's head against the wall, and you had the, ZACK: Clarity of will to sh**t him.
BRENNAN: Is that why you picked up the g*n? In case my fingerprints were on it?
ZACK: I've learnt a lot from Mr. Hodgins' books.
(Cut to: interior BOOTH and BRENNAN'S APPARTMENT - BEDROOM. BOOTH is getting changed)
(BRENNAN enters)
BRENNAN: Zack and Sweets found my Belgian Corduroy coat and b*rned it because it had a b*llet hole in it.
BOOTH: Oh, wow, are you serious?
BRENNAN: Yeah, the figured you bashed his head against the wall and I sh*t him.
BOOTH: Should I be upset that everyone thinks that we're m*rder, or just happy that everyone's trying to help us get away with it?
BRENNAN: You should recognise that everything they do to try to help just makes us look more guilty! Especially you.
BOOTH: Why me?
BRENNAN: Because you are strong enough to bash his head into the wall and I'm not.
BOOTH: Oh, so, are we having some doubts?
BRENNAN: Not about anything important. Here.
(BRENNAN goes over to fix BOOTH'S tie, BOOTH kisses BRENNAN)
(Cut to: exterior THE STREET - THE ROYAL DINER. JARED and BOOTH are walking together)
JARED: Yeah, the fibres we found in the wound track are Belgian Corduroy, how'd you know?
BOOTH: We can't find Bren's coat!
JARED: If it's in that club we'll eventually find it so, BOOTH: Yeah, I know, I heard you the first time! Get rid of it, burn it, whatever. The problem is, I didn't k*ll the guy.
Max says that you're in the Gravedigger's pocket. Did he send this man?
JARED: Max is nuts, and crooked as a stick in water.
(JARED and BOOTH enter the ROYAL DINER)
BOOTH: Oh, hey, hey, somebody put this Worstenbach guy on Bren.
(JARED looks down)
BOOTH: What?
JARED: You're not gonna like it.
BOOTH: Somebody comes into my club to hurt my wife, of course I'm not gonna like it!
JARED: Bren was cheating on you with the Persian.
BOOTH: (scoffs) You got that wrong.
(JARED pulls some phone records from his jacket pocket)
JARED: She met with him over a dozen times, over 70 phone calls over the past two weeks. How many times a day you talk to her?
(BOOTH looks at JARED incredulously)
JARED: This is what happened. They get into a thing, it goes south, Bren figures that it's not true love and that the Persian wants her for your nightclub.
(BOOTH stands up, JARED does too)
JARED: And then he threatens her, he sends this Worstenbach guy on the job, but you don't see it, because you don't use your head. You think that everything you feel is true,
(BOOTH punches JARED in the face and walks out)
JARED: You need to grow up.
(Cut to: interior THE LAB. BOOTH enters, ANGELA is checking the guest list)
ANGELA: Hey, Mr. B. Anybody else get arrested?
BOOTH: Not that I know of. Hey, listen, Ange, you know the napkin you drew for Worstenbach, ANGELA: Yeah, I'm sorry about that, I didn't know what he wanted it for, BOOTH: No, uh, I know that, I, uh, just, why wasn't it finished?
ANGELA: Oh, well, I got interrupted.
BOOTH: Interrupted? By who?
ANGELA: By Jared. He came in to ask me out.
BOOTH: (scoffs) Jared saw Worstenbach and the napkin?
ANGELA: (nods)
BOOTH: Right. You seen Max?
ANGELA: Yeah, uh, table 11.
(BOOTH walks over to TABLE 11 where MAX is seated, on the way he passes a ROADIE for MOLTLEY CRUE)
ROADIE: (to BOOTH) Hey, as soon as The Crue gets here we'll do a sound check.
BOOTH: That's great.
ROADIE: What time you want us to go on?
BOOTH: Midnight.
ROADIE: You got it, give or take.
(BOOTH arrives at MAX'S TABLE)
BOOTH: So, the cops think I committed the m*rder!
MAX: The cops are the least of your worries. Make the payment.
BOOTH: Right, you tell the Gravedigger that unless he's willing to k*ll me, it's over. Oh, one more thing, anything happens to my wife, it's you I'm coming after.
MAX: Woah, woah, woah, me? I'm just the messenger!
BOOTH: (scoffs) Oh, I don't know how you got Jared to believe that crap, but my gut is telling me you're nobodies messenger.
(BOOTH exits, MAX calls after him)
MAX: It's only money! I hate it when people say that.
(Cut to: interior THE LAB. CLARK is entering with an entourage of women. He waves to BRENNAN and BOOTH who are standing on THE CATWALK above THE PLATFORM)
(Pan to BRENNAN and BOOTH on THE CATWALK)
BRENNAN: So, did the police try to convince you that I was having an affair with Arastoo?
BOOTH: It's what they do, you know, drive wedges.
BRENNAN: It wouldn't be irrational to think that I was having an affair with him. He's very handsome.
BOOTH: Yeah, I'd feel if the energy was bad between the two us, I'd know. The same way that you would know that I couldn't m*rder someone.
BRENNAN: I do believe that you would m*rder someone for me. And I believe that you'd lie about it so I wouldn't have to carry that burden.
RANDOM GIRL: Tommy! Tommy! I love you!
(Pan to THE PLATFORM, MOTLEY CRUE enter)
BRENNAN: Hey, Nicky! Vince!
NICKY: S'up!
BOOTH: Excellent update on the lid, Nick.
(MOTLEY CRUE do their sound check)
MOTLEY CRUE'S MANAGER: Listen, go bigger, go louder, or just go home.
(Pan to BRENNAN and BOOTH on THE CATWALK)
BRENNAN: (to BOOTH) How did you convince them to leave Crue fest and appear here?
BOOTH: Benefit for the kids.
BRENNAN: We're doing a benefit for sick kids? Aww!
(BRENNAN kisses BOOTH'S cheek)
BRENNAN: Poor Cam and Jared. You know, if this m*rder is any inclination, I don't know how any homicide is ever solved. When everyone lies, everyone has a secret agenda. I'm glad we're nightclub owners and not crime solvers.
BOOTH: I know who did it.
BRENNAN: So do I.
(Cut to WENDELL, VINCENT and CAM entering THE BAR)
WENDELL: Awesome, it's the Crue!
VINCENT: I've been bounced by a rock band!
(MAX exits the club, whispering in CAM'S ear on the way out)
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - BRENNAN'S OFFICE. BRENNAN and BOOTH are entering)
BOOTH: When did you realise it wasn't me? (pours himself a large drink of whiskey)
BRENNAN: You would k*ll for me, I know that, but whoever did this knocked him out, got my coat, before executing him. You would never do that. Jared is different.
BOOTH: My brother k*ll a man to save my wife. What are we gonna do? (takes a large sip of whiskey)
BRENNAN: Do? We thank him and shut-up.
BOOTH: Bren, this is m*rder!
BRENNAN: It's more like a rescue.
BOOTH: Not everything is just so clear to you!
BRENNAN: It is this time.
BOOTH: I don't think I can live with this.
(WENDELL enters)
WENDELL: Boss?
(Cut to: exterior THE LAB - THE ALLEY. BOOTH, BRENNAN and WENDELL are exiting THE LAB into THE ALLEY. CAM is holding JARED at g*n, CAROLINE and MAX also enter)
JARED: I'm not going to prison.
CAM: GPS puts you in this building at the time of the m*rder.
MAX: Hey, I told you, no cell phone, no GPS. Should listen to me.
CAM: Lose the w*apon Detective.
JARED: (shakes his head)
BOOTH: Jared, just take out you g*n.
JARED: Oh, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. You ready? I'm a quick bastard.
CAM: By the barrel, nice and slowly.
JARED: That's not how it's gonna go.
(JARED reaches down to his holser)
JARED: We both know how this is gonna go.
(CAM cocks her g*n)
(BRENNAN walks between CAM and JARED)
BOOTH: Bren!
BRENNAN: It's OK, it's all ok. (to JARED) Thank you.
(CAM lowers her g*n)
BRENNAN: You helped us. Now please, let us help you.
(JARED gives his g*n to BRENNAN, who then passes it to CAM)
ANNOUNCER: (voice over) Please welcome to the stage, Motley Crue!
CAM: Put the handcuffs on, Jared.
(JARED handcuffs himself)
(Cut to: interior THE LAB - THE PLATFORM. MOTLEY CRUE play "Dr. Feelgood")
(Scene fades to white, then fades back to THE LAB at closing time)
HODGINS: [narrating] You love someone, you open yourself up to suffering; that's the sad truth. Maybe they'll break your heart; maybe you'll break their heart and never be able to look at yourself in the same way. Those are the risks.
WENDELL: (voice-over) Locking up now, Boss!
(Pan to BRENNAN'S OFFICE, BOOTH is standing in the doorway while BRENNAN stands behind her desk)
BOOTH: Thanks, Wendell. You know, I think you're right, you know, I think we should sell out.
BRENNAN: You're not afraid of this Gravedigger person?
BOOTH: Nah, I told him if he didn't leave us alone I'd k*ll him. And he believes me.
(BOOTH sits down in an armchair)
BRENNAN: You mean you told Max to tell him.
BOOTH: Yeah.
BRENNAN: Mhm. Caroline says if they can't trace the g*n to Jared, they can't find my coat, he's going to walk. We can't sell the club; your brother might need a job. Plus, I have another confession.
BOOTH: What?
HODGINS: [narrating] You see two people and think they belong together, but nothing happens,
(BRENNAN sits herself on BOOTH'S lap)
BRENNAN: Well, you know that glass of wine that we share every night?
BOOTH: Yeah... BRENNAN: I have to stop that.
BOOTH: Oh c'mon, Bren. Just because you have one glass of wine every night with your husband, doesn't mean you're an alcoholic.
BRENNAN: That's not why.
(BOOTH realises what BRENNAN is trying to say and grins)
BOOTH: No way!
BRENNAN: (chuckles)
BOOTH: Yeah!
(BOOTH kisses BRENNAN)
BOOTH: You are pregnant! There's a little baby boy, huh?
BRENNAN: Or girl... HODGINS: [narrating] The thought of losing so much control over personal happiness is unbearable.
(Scene fades to BOOTH lying in a hospital bed after his brain surgery, BRENNAN is sitting in a chair next to the bed typing on her laptop: "You love someone, you open yourself up to suffering, that's the sad truth. Maybe they'll break your heart; maybe you'll break their heart and never be able to look at yourself in the same way. Those are the risks. That's the burden. Like wings, they have weight, we feel that weight on our backs, but they are a burden that lifts us. Burdens which -." [NOTE: Text differs from HODGINS narration slightly])
HODGINS: [narrating] That's the burden. Like wings, they have weight, we feel that weight on out backs, but they are a burden that lifts us. Burdens that-
BRENNAN and HODGINS: [narrating] allow us to fly.
(BRENNAN looks over at BOOTH and then back to her computer. She considers what she has written, and then deletes it)
BOOTH: Such a weird dream, BRENNAN: Booth? Booth! You're awake!
BOOTH: So real.
BRENNAN: You're operation was a success, but you reacted poorly to the anaesthesia. You've been in a coma for the past four days. What took you so long to wake up?
BOOTH: It felt so real.
BRENNAN: It wasn't real.
BOOTH: Who are you?
(BRENNAN is taken aback and looks hurt)
END.
