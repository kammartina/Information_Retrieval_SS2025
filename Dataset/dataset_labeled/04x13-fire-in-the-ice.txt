(Cut to ice rink. Whistle blows. Booth skating around on ice. Shots of various other ice hockey players from both teams.)
REFEREE: Let's have a nice clean game, everyone. (Referee throws puck onto ice) Down.
BOOTH: Come on, move the puck, (skates out of sh*t) Wendell! Move it! Move the puck!
WENDELL: (off screen) Up here, Booth. Up here!
FIREDAWG: Back on D.
BOOTH: Pick 'em up, on D, pick 'em up.
(Brennan, Cam and Sweets in stands watching the game)
BRENNAN + CAM: Go, Booth! Go, Booth! Go, Booth!
SWEETS: Wow CAM: k*ll 'em, Booth!
(Booth smashes Firedawgs player in to the screen in front of supporters.)
BRENNAN: What did he do that for?
CAM: It's what Booth does. Keeps the other team honest. He's what you call an enforcer.
BRENNAN: What, like law enforcement?
CAM: Yeah, okay. Well, let's go with that.
(Firedawgs player smashes into Wendell, knocking him down)
BOOTH: Oh, what was that? What about the crosscheck? Ref, are you blind?
WENDELL: Pass it! I'm open! Pass it! I'm open!
BOOTH: Pick him off!
(Firedawgs score a goal)
PETE CARLSON: Yeah!
BOOTH: That was a cheap sh*t, Carlson.
ED FRALIC: Yeah, you guys suck.
REFEREE: That's 24 blue, two minutes for charging.
BOOTH: For what? What about the crosscheck back there, huh?
REFEREE: Get in the box!
ALEX PINNA: Come on, man. It's hockey.
BOOTH: Club hockey, and some of us have to go work in the morning, all right, pal?
(Referee separates Booth from Carlson)
REFEREE: Enough. Let's go.
ALEX PINNA: Carlson, calm down! Skate away.
REFEREE: Just go in the box. Go on, get in there and sit down.
CARLSON: Yeah, sit down, crybaby.
(Booth gets into penalty box, right next to where Brennan, Cam and Sweets are sitting.)
REFEREE: Let's go. Let's go.
BRENNAN: So, this is punitive, right? To be sent to this little area here?
BOOTH: Keep your head up next time, number 12. Keep your head up.
CARLSON: Yeah, yeah, I'll be waiting.
BOOTH: Come on!
CAM: It's called a penalty box, you know, send in.
SWEETS: Yeah, Booth committed a penalty when he checked the big guy when he didn't have the puck.
ED FRALIC: Stay with him, Carlson. Just stay with him.
(Carlson trips Wendell)
BOOTH: There's a hit right there, Ref, that you missed again BRENNAN: Booth seems quite anxious to get out of the disciplinary box.
SWEETS: Yeah, I've never seen him this agitated before.
BOOTH: Open man! Open man!
(Firedawgs score and celebrate)
BRENNAN: That's not good, right?
SWEETS + CAM: No.
(Booth returns to ice)
BRENNAN: Go, Booth! (referee throws down puck) Wendell might get a basket!
(Carlson takes down Wendell)
BOOTH: Elbow, Ref! Elbow!
BRENNAN: Is Wendell okay?
SWEETS: That can't be legal.
CAM: It definitely is not.
(Whistle blows)
Come on, Ref, you got to call BOOTH: Come on, what are you doing, Carlson?
CARLSON: Want to go?
(Booth and Carlson fighting)
BOOTH: Come on, come on. Let's go. Come on, let's go.
CAM: (off screen) Come on, Booth!
BOOTH: You're a dirty player, Carlson.
ALEX PINNA: Come on, bro. Get your hands free. Get your hands free.
BOOTH: You don't take shots at my guys. You got that? Ends here. Okay, Carlson? Ends here.
BRENNAN: Booth seems to be winning.
CAM: Well, it's not Booth I'm worried about.
ED FRALIC: That guy's out of control.
ALEX PINNA: No more.
REFEREE: I'm gonna have to call a game misconduct on that one.
BOOTH: All right. You get up off the ice, we'll finish this in the parking lot. Come on. If you did your job, I wouldn't have to do it for you. Look at him. (Booth skates away) He's hitting my guys. You all right, buddy? Son of a bitch. (Clapping and Booth picks up Wendell) Get up. You all right?
WENDELL: Oh, did I score, man?
BOOTH: Oh, yeah. Yeah... Come on.
BRENNAN: I do not know how I feel about this.
SWEETS: It's very primal.
CAM: I like it just a little too much.
PLAYERS ON ICE: Come on, team. All right, come on, let's focus.
(Cut to locker room)
BOOTH: So, you still seeing double?
WENDELL: Only when I open more than one eye. Your hand's busted.
BOOTH: Yeah, well, you know, guy left his helmet on.
(Brennan opens door to locker room)
BRENNAN: Hey, you two all right? (pause) What?
BOOTH: Want to wait outside?
BRENNAN: But your hand might be broken. Do you want me to look at it?
BOOTH: No, it's all right. You can wait outside please. It's a men's locker room, Bones.
(Brennan closes the door)
(Cut to icy river. A man (Len) and his son (Leo) are sat down inside a wooden shack)
LEN: There comes a time in ice fishing when it's time for the father to turn the drilling over to his son.
LEO: Man, this is a great day. You give me a beer, let me run the augur.
LEN: Yup. You're 18,Leo. You start drilling holes, it's safety first. You got me?
LEO: Yeah.
LEN: Nothing I'm saying here applies only to ice augurs. You get me?
LEO: All right.
LEN: Good. You know, that way, you don't fall through the ice and die, or get a disease, or get pregnant.
LEO: Dad, come on.
LEN: Okay. Go ahead.
LEO: All right.
LEN: Atta boy. Keep her perpendicular. Once you get it in a little bit, you can speed her up, let her rip. All right, let her rip.
LEO: Dad, she-she's bleeding. I... she's bleeding.
(bl*od around the freshly drilled hole in the snow)
LEN: Pull out. Pull out.
LEO: Oh, I hope that's fish.
(Len clears the snow away to reveal a head under the ice)
LEN: You better go wait in the truck.
(Cut to Brennan and Booth, with his arm in a cast, in a white tent with various FBI and police standing around)
BOOTH: Hey, uh, what do you think there, Bones?
BRENNAN: I would surmise that the body went into the lake before it froze, then the lake froze, then the body floated up and became attached to the bottom of the ice.
BOOTH: I meant, was he m*rder?
BRENNAN: Oh, Um, maybe. Could have been an accident or a su1c1de, except...
(Booth sticking pen inside of his cast) Oh, you shouldn't do that.
BOOTH: It itches, okay? Yeah, well, except for what?
BRENNAN: Trauma to the left maxillary orbit suggests violence. It's kind of gross, what you're doing.
BOOTH: Gross? You got your finger in some guy's maxillary orbit.
BRENNAN: I don't think there's anything else to be learned here, so let's get this Popsicle back to the lab.
BOOTH: Hey, look at that. Bones, you made a joke.
BRENNAN: Well, I can be quite amusing.
BOOTH: Wait a second. (picks up necklace)
BRENNAN: Booth, you aren't wearing any gloves.
BOOTH: Bones, I...Remember that guy I punched out last month during my hockey game? Pete Carlson?
BRENNAN: Yes. When you broke your hand.
BOOTH: That's him.
I'm a suspect. (Booth hands over necklace) Here.
(Opening credits)
(Cut to FBI office, Brennan and Perotta sat at the table, with Caroline stood by the table and Booth stood in the doorway)
CAROLINE: Given that Agent Booth is currently the prime suspect in this m*rder...
BRENNAN: We don't know it's a m*rder.
BOOTH: Oh, look at that-- I'm the prime suspect.
CAROLINE: Agent Payton Perotta here will be working with Dr. Brennan.
BRENNAN: I won't work the case without Booth.
PEROTTA: In that case, I invite Agent Booth's continued participation. In the background as an advisor.
CAROLINE: Agent Payton Perotta has earned bachelors degrees in both forensic science and criminology.
BRENNAN: Well, anything short of a doctorate is virtually useless at my level.
CAROLINE: How would you like to proceed, darling?
BOOTH: Well, it's pretty obvious. We definitely want to interrogate the primary suspect, right?
PEROTTA: Yeah.
(Cut to Medico Legal Law - Autopsy Bay. Wendell and Cam on either side of the table, Hodgins at a microscope on the side)
CAM: Based on decomp, I'd put time of death at about five days prior to freezing.
WENDELL: Local cops say the lake froze over three weeks ago.
HODGINS: Aside from some dormant anopheles mosquito larvae, I imagine whatever the water from the lake tells us, it'll be through a microscope.
WENDELL: If Booth is a suspect, then I should be, too. This guy scrambled my brains.
CAM: Your alibi is that you were seeing double and being taken care of by your mother.
HODGINS: I'll get on the fluid samples you took from the lungs and oesophagus. Could be the vic was drowned somewhere else and then dumped in the lake.
CAM: No. Drowning's not the way Booth would k*ll someone. Not that I actually suspect Booth. At all. (stuttering) Quit staring at me.
(Hodgins and Wendell exchange looks)
(Cut to interrogation room. Booth and Perotta on opposite sides of the table)
BOOTH: In the course of the game, the v*ctim and I exchanged blows.
PEROTTA: Who initiated the fight?
BOOTH: It was hockey.
PEROTTA: So, it was spontaneous combustion?
BOOTH: The guy hit two of my players. The-The ref-- he didn't catch that.
PEROTTA: And that made you angry?
BOOTH: Not angry enough, you know, to chase him down after the game and k*ll him.
PEROTTA: So, where did you go after the game?
BOOTH: Uh, Bones drove me and Wendell to the hospital.
PEROTTA: So, alibi that night or the next?
BOOTH: Bones and I are just partners.
PEROTTA: Okay. Now you're answering questions I had no intention of asking. Is it your contention that, uh, your argument with the v*ctim was constrained to the ice?
BOOTH: That is my contention.
PEROTTA: 'Cause I have a-a witness who stated you told Carlson, and I quote, "You get up off that ice, and we'll settle this out in the parking lot."
BOOTH: Trash talking.
PEROTTA: Let me cut to the chase here. Did you k*ll Pete Carlson?
BOOTH: No.
PEROTTA: Did you dump his body in the lake?
BOOTH: No, I did not, Agent Perotta.
PEROTTA: Do you feel that your experience as the child of an abusive alcoholic has made you more prone to violence?
BOOTH: Excuse me. (Gets up and leaves room, slamming door. Walks through hallway to room behind the mirror, where Sweets is standing) What the hell are you doing?
SWEETS: It's part of my job to assist the interrogating agent.
BOOTH: You know I didn't m*rder anyone, Sweets, all right? So what you're doing right now is you're just studying me.
SWEETS: That's part of our agreement, too.
BOOTH: You have a question for me, you ask me yourself. Don't use her.
SWEETS: All right, okay, two questions. One: am I picking up some sexual tension between you and Agent Perotta?
BOOTH: How the hell do I know what you're picking up?
SWEETS: Okay. Uh, two: underneath your affable exterior is a deep reservoir of rage.
My question is, do you always have that under control?
BOOTH: You know, if I didn't, you'd be dead right now instead of just wincing.
SWEETS: I'm not wincing.
BOOTH: Don't ever bring my old man up again. (turns and leaves, slamming door)
SWEETS: Rats. I winced.
(Cut back to interrogation room, Booth re-enters and sits down)
BOOTH: So... Do you have any more questions? Thank you.
PEROTTA: Yeah. You work out much?
BOOTH: Yeah, I'm pretty consistent.
PEROTTA: You look like you take excellent care of yourself.
(zoom out to see Sweets behind mirror, walking away)
SWEETS: Okay, this is useless.
(Cut to Medico Legal Lab - Workroom. Cam and Wendell are looking at x-rays)
WENDELL: Both patellas are fractured.
CAM: As though he'd fallen to his knees?
WENDELL: Yeah, with a great deal of force.
CAM: During a hockey game?
WENDELL: No, not if he wore pads. I believe that this is the cause of death.
CAM: Penetration of the lachrymal sac here, deep into the inferior orbital fissure.
WENDELL: Yeah, I would have thought a small calibre b*llet, but...
CAM: No sign of b*llet fragments.
WENDELL: Yeah.
(Cut to Pete Carlson's apartment. Booth, Brennan and Perotta enter with Connie Withers)
CONNIE WITHERS: This is Pete's apartment. He wasn't the best housekeeper.
PEROTTA: Ms. Withers, was Mr. Carlson up to date on his rent?
BOOTH: Good question. Great start.
CONNIE WITHERS: Uh, yes. Mostly. 500 bucks short. He didn't need much. He was a big kid at heart. Poor Pete. What he really loved was hockey. I wouldn't be surprised if that's why he joined the volunteer fire department. I even got him this necklace. Crossed hockey sticks.
PEROTTA: You attended his games?
CONNIE WITHERS: Oh, all of them. Yeah.
PEROTTA: You were a couple?
BRENNAN: It looks like someone went through all of his belongings and then left them on the floor.
CONNIE WITHERS: Oh, it always looked like that.
PEROTTA: The car outside with the flat tires, is that his?
CONNIE WITHERS: Yeah, somebody slashed the tires just before he disappeared.
PEROTTA: Why didn't you report him missing?
CONNIE WITHERS: I thought maybe, uh... I thought he was staying with someone else.
PEROTTA: There's a lot of bills here. (looking at envelopes) "Final notice, past due..."
BRENNAN: Looks like he couldn't afford to feed his fish, either.
PEROTTA: "Albie,Thursday,11:00 p.m." (takes post-it-note from wall) Do you know who Albie is?
CONNIE WITHERS: I don't know.
BRENNAN: This is bl*od.
BOOTH: It's a hockey jersey, Bones. You know, hockey players bleed sometimes when they play the game.
PEROTTA: Ms. Withers, how bad were his financial problems?
CONNIE WITHERS: Well, a couple days before Pete disappeared, he asked me for $2,000.
PEROTTA: Did he say what for?
CONNIE WITHERS: He liked me. You know? He was one of these guys, he... he didn't say much, but he could be real sweet. And a man borrows money from a woman, it means there's a bond of trust, right?
BRENNAN: I don't understand your reasoning.
BOOTH: I do. It's definitely a bond of trust. You're absolutely right.
PEROTTA: We're terribly sorry for your loss.
(Cut to Medico Legal Lab - Autopsy Bay. Cam looking at body, Brennan walks in)
BRENNAN: Is that our v*ctim?
CAM: Yes. The last of the tissue samples. Wendell can clean the skeleton now and you can do your thing.
BRENNA: You still think cause of death was a projectile through the left eye?
CAM: Yes, but since we found no b*llet, nor any indication of g*n residue in the wound, we're stumped as to what kind of projectile.
BRENNAN: The alveolus around the incisor is cracked, the socket caked with bl*od. This is a recent loss.
CAM: Well, he was a hockey player.
BRENNAN: So basically, we're talking about gladiators.
CAM: And I love it.
BRENNAN: Perhaps the sight of males battling stimulates the part of your brain which has so far failed to find a suitable mate.
(Hodgins enters)
CAM: And thank God you're here.
HODGINS: The water I found in the v*ctim's oesophagus, not from the lake. Lake water is microorganism infested. Water in his throat, deionized brine water.
CAM: He was k*ll, then dumped in the ocean then dumped in the lake?
HODGINS: Deionized brine water freezes clear. It contains an anti-freezing agent, which I know sounds counterintuitive...
BRENNAN: Ice rinks.
HODGINS: Kind of jumped my punch line there, Dr. B. But, yes. We should see what rinks are closest to the lake.
CAM: It's the one Booth played at.
BRENNAN: I find it interesting that the evidence keeps pointing toward Booth.
(Close up on body)
(Cut back to ice rink. Practice going on in background, Perotta and Booth talking to Dave Simms and Ed Fralic)
DAVE SIMMS: Pete Carlson was m*rder?
ED FRALIC: Pete, he's indestructible.
DAVE SIMMS: Not so indestructible. This guy took him down a few notches. Made him stay down, too.
BOOTH: Well, it was the heat of the game. All right, your guy crossed the line.
ED FRALIC: He was our enforcer. Took the job real serious.
DAVE SIMMS: Well, whoever got Pete must've got a drop on him. Pete wouldn't go easy.
PEROTTA: You mind my asking why nobody reported him missing?
ED FRALIC: Well, the night after you flattened Pete, we go up against the State Police. Then Pete gets into a beef with a big State Police left-winger.
DAVE SIMMS: 'Cause you handed him his ass on a platter, Pete maybe had something to prove that night.
BOOTH: You got a name?
DAVE SIMMS: Hey, Alex? Yo! Come here!
ED FRALIC: The fuzz player that Pete got into it with his last game, do you remember his name?
ALEX PINNA: Yeah, Lou Herrin, number five.
ED FRALIC: Pete took Herrin down with a real cheap sh*t. He got tossed out the rest of the season.
PEROTTA: Any chance that Pete and this guy, Herrin, continued their fight off the ice?
DAVE SIMMS: People threaten.
ED FRALIC: Yeah, but nobody carries through.
BOOTH: Yeah, keep it on the ice, right?
ED FRALIC: If I were you, I would talk to Chloe.
PEROTTA: Who's Chloe?
ED FRALIC: Chloe Bratton.
DAVE SIMMS: Chloe's a puck bunny. Her and Pete put in some quality mattress time before he dumped her.
ALEX: Well, mattress really isn't, uh, Chloe's style. No offense.
PEROTTA: None taken. I favour backseats myself.
(Chloe spinning around on the ice)
(Cut to Perotta and Booth talking to Chloe in stands above ice rink)
CHLOE: I can't believe Pete's gone.
PEROTTA: How long ago did you two break up?
CHLOE: Break up? We didn't break up.
BOOTH: His teammates think you did.
CHLOE: No, we had this on-again/off-again thing. It was casual. No biggie.
PEROTTA: So you didn't mind that he slept with different women?
CHLOE: I wouldn't have minded if he did, but I happen to know he didn't.
BOOTH: Well, I happen to know, that he did. Right.
CHLOE: Who?
PEROTTA: Oh it doesn't matter, does it? Given that your relationship was so, um, casual?
BOOTH: You slashed his tires, didn't you?
PEROTTA: Agent Booth...
CHLOE: No.
PEROTTA: We can prove you did it, Chloe, so here's the deal: you tell us the truth from now on, and we won't charge you with vandalism and obstruction of justice, okay?
BOOTH: Let's try this again. You slashed...
PEROTTA: Agent Booth?
BOOTH: Yes. Of course.
PEROTTA: Let's try this again. You slashed his tires, didn't you?
CHLOE: Yes. I mean, he was sleeping with someone else. I got passions that take over sometimes. You know how it is when the guy you give yourself to just goes off with someone else.
PEROTTA: Who's, um, Albie?
CHLOE: Albie? Albie runs this poker game in back of a Chinese food joint off I Street.
Probably why Pete was broke all the time. So, who'd you say Pete was sleeping with?
PEROTTA:I think we've got enough information for today, Ms. Bratton. Thank you very much for your cooperation.
BOOTH: Thanks.
(Cut to Medico Legal Lab - Forensics Platform. Brennan, Wendell, Cam and Angela around a table with the bones on)
CAM: Any luck with the m*rder w*apon?
BRENNAN: Yes. We are certain it is not a screwdriver.
CAM: Well, the bl*od on the v*ctim's jersey was all his own.
BRENNAN: The rib cage has been bruised.
WENDELL: It has?
BRENNAN: Yes. See this vague pattern of bone bruising?
WENDELL: Yeah, it extends from the right clavicle through anterior ribs four through eight.
BRENNAN: He was struck repeatedly.
ANGELA: Like, by a hockey stick? During the game maybe?
WENDELL: Not during. The, um, padding would prevent that kind of bruising. I'll take a closer look. I can't believe I missed that.
(Cam signalling to Brennan. Brennan mouths "What?" Cam continues to nod towards Wendell)
BRENNAN: No, I can't believe you missed that, either.
(Wendell turns and leaves)
CAM: I was signalling you to encourage Wendell by saying anyone could've missed that, but...
BRENNAN: You should have said so. Booth says I stink at nonverbal communication.

(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
(Cut to Perotta and Booth entering Chinese restaurant)
PEROTTA: She said in the back BOOTH: Okay, well, just don't be pulling your g*n until you go through the kitchen, or Mama-san there is going to hit the panic button. Okay, just...
(Booth stops to remove g*n from his ankle holster)
PEROTTA: Ah, so you're ready to risk a g*n with your w*apon in the wrong hand?
BOOTH: I don't have a wrong hand.
PERTOTTA: I'm curious. When you sh**t with your left hand, does it feel like somebody else is sh**ting?
(Booth breaks through door. Booth and Perotta raise their g*n and men inside point g*n at them)
PEROTTA: What do we do now?
BOOTH: Okay, FBI. Okay, I'd reach for my badge right now, but, you know...
PEROTTA: Drop your w*apon, please.
BOOTH: "Please"? The FBI does not say "please." Okay, look. I really don't care about the illegal gambling. I just want to talk to a guy named Albie about a guy named Pete Carlson.
ALBIE: I'm Albie.
(Cut to back room - Booth, Perotta and Albie sat at table)
ALBIE: First rule: don't k*ll the people who owe you money.
All you get then is trouble and no money.
PEROTTA: How much money did Carlson owe you?
BOOTH: Okay, so you got your operation shut down and moved out? Because I can have my guys here in about what, three minutes to mop that back room up?
ALBIE: Pete Carlson was not a bad player most of the time, but... you know, every once in a while...
BOOTH: He got brave and lost everything, huh?
ALBIE: Gamble a bit yourself, do you?
BOOTH: I'm reformed.
PEROTTA: Tell me, when was the last time Carlson got, um, brave?
ALBIE: Last month. But he paid up in full a couple days later.
PEROTTA: Cash?
(Albie takes bracelet from around her wrist and puts it on the table.)
BOOTH: Little garish, don't you think?
ALBIE: I don't know where Pete got it, but it covered his debt.
PEROTTA: I'm going to have to take this.
ALBIE: If I didn't intend to give it to you, you'd never have seen it. Okay, you gave me the time I needed to move my operation, I gave you evidence. I call us square. You decide to get back into the game, you look me up.
BOOTH: Right. Yeah.
PEROTTA: Well, we gonna call this in?
BOOTH: Oh, no point. Like the woman said, she's moved on.
(Cut to ice rink. Perotta, Brennan and Booth go onto ice, with Booth slipping and nearly falling)
BRENNAN: Hodgins confirmed that the traces of rink water in the v*ctim's oesophagus came from this rink.
BOOTH: Well, how did rink ice get into his throat?
BRENNAN: He was b*at, then a sharp instrument was thrust into his eye.
There should be bloodstains.
PEROTTA: You're going to scan the ice with one little wand?
I'll call in an FBI forensics team. We'll have the whole place searched.
BOOTH: No need. All you need is black light, right?
BRENNAN: Yes.
BOOTH: Right? I got a great idea, just stay here. It's very slippery, don't move.
(Booth walks off the ice. The lights go off so that it's only black light, making everything blue)
BOOTH: Ready? How's that, huh?
PEROTTA: Nice.
BOOTH: Gonna work?
PEROTTA: Well, I see some, uh, flecks of bl*od.
BRENNAN: No we're looking for something bigger than these small specs and spots.
PEROTTA: Uh, the v*ctim was stabbed in the eye. We're looking for a pretty significant puddle.
BOOTH: Right, two guys get into a beef, then they put their street clothes on and then come back here on the ice to duke it out? No.
PEROTTA: Booth?
BOOTH: Yeah?
(All looking at a big patch of white amongst the blue of the ice)
PEROTTA: My God.
BRENNAN: This is going to turn out to be where Pete Carlson was m*rder.
(Cut to Medico Legal Lab - Forensic Platform. There are various large containers of ice/water. Cam enters platform and walks to Hodgins who is fishing through one of the containers.)
CAM: This is all the ice from the crime scene, including the scrapings from the Zamboni.
HODGINS: We should be able to get enough DNA out of this to confirm the bl*od is Carlson's. Whoa. Human tooth.
CAM: It's hockey. That Zamboni probably had a hundred teeth in there.
HODGINS: Looks like we found where the Tooth Fairy winters.
(Cut to Medico Legal Lab - workroom. Wendell is standing at a table with the bones on. Hodgins enters)
HODGINS: Did you find a match yet?
WENDELL: Just started.
HODGINS: Cam says it's definitely the v*ctim's bl*od.
WENDELL: I still haven't found the m*rder w*apon.
HODGINS: Yeah, I know, I still haven't identified the nylon polymer I found on the v*ctim's shirt.
(Angela enters)
ANGELA: So, I've looked at, like, a thousand photos of those bl*od patterns at the rink. And tons from the apartment.
WENDELL: Why, what are you looking for?
ANGELA: Here's a bl*od pattern at the rink. The body was dragged in that direction.
WENDELL: Yeah, the body was dragged that way, but what are those drops over there?
ANGELA: What drops?
WENDELL: Those drops right there.
HODGINS: They parallel the dragging body. And they aren't smeared.
ANGELA: These parallel drops aren't from the v*ctim. They're from whoever dragged him across the ice.
HODGINS: Well, that means we have to check for more than just Pete's DNA.
ANGELA: Too bad we can't question the fish.
WENDELL: What k*ll those fish?
ANGELA: Not eating for three weeks.
WENDELL: If that happened, they would eat each other.
HODGINS: Grab your coat. We're going on a field trip. And tell Cam to check the rink samples to find out if there was a second source of DNA.
(Hodgins and Wendell leave)
ANGELA: I'm not really a big fan of this... barking out orders stuff.
(cut to Sweets's office)
SWEETS: Agent Booth, it's come to the attention of the deputy director that you are a viable suspect in a m*rder case.
BOOTH: Right, okay, and he wants you to make sure that I'm not viable.
SWEETS: That's correct.
BOOTH: Come on, Sweets, you know I didn't k*ll anyone. So, you know, put that in shrink talk and write out your little form and send it in.
SWEETS: Mm-hmm, yes, of course, but to do that, I need to ask you some questions.
BOOTH: Great. sh**t.
SWEETS: I saw you in that game. You b*at another man to the ice.
BOOTH: It's hockey. I was protecting my teammate.
SWEETS: You broke your hand on his helmet.
BOOTH: It's hockey. Okay, you never played, did you?
SWEETS: Oh, I'd run track and cross country and did some wrestling and ch...
BOOTH: Chess!
SWEETS: No.
BOOTH: Checkers?
SWEETS: Didn't say that.
BOOTH: You know what? Then you know nothing... It's about teams, okay? And teamwork. Obviously you don't know anything about that, Dr. Sweets.
SWEETS: You joined the army. You became a sn*per. You joined the FBI. Do you see the, uh, the binding element in those choices? It's violence.
BOOTH: Or the love of uniforms. You ever think that?
SWEETS: Agent Booth, I believe that you are ready to confront the fact that the violence you may have suffered in childhood BOOTH: You know what?
SWEETS: has followed you into adulthood.
BOOTH: Fill out the form.
(knocking at the door)
SWEETS: Not now!
(Caroline enters)
CAROLINE: Hiya, Sweets. Uh, if you're about finished here, Booth, in accordance with the warrant you made me get, Pete Carlson's phone records are here.
SWEETS: Ms. Julian, actually, I'm the one that decides when we're done here.
CAROLINE: Of course you are, Cherie, no offense intended. I'll be delivering the phone records to Agent Perotta. I thought I'd do that in your office.
(Caroline leaves and closes the door)
BOOTH: Thanks, Cherie. We're done.
(Booth stands and moves to door)
SWEETS: Well, we are done but that was just a coincidence.
(Booth standing in doorway)
BOOTH: Sweets, I've k*ll but I've never m*rder before. Look up the difference in your little black book there, okay?
(Cut to Pete Carlson's apartment. Wendell and Hodgins enter)
WENDELL: This is legal, right?
HODGINS: Absolutely.
WENDELL: Okay.
HODGINS: None of them look nibbled on. Oh, man, they should've gone at each other like a Peruvian soccer team stranded in the Andes.
WENDELL: Then they all died at the same time. I don't see what this is going to tell us.
(Wendell taking photos of fish t*nk. Hodgins scooping fish out of the t*nk)
HODGINS: How they died?
WENDELL: No, no, I mean about the case.
HODGINS: Ooh, if Brennan were here, she'd smack your face. Her philosophy is, we find out the facts about everything, then see how it fits together. Photo opportunity.
(Hodgins poses for photo holding up bag of dead fish)
(Cut to Booth's office. Booth and Caroline sat on either side of the desk. Perotta standing)
PEROTTA: Pete made eight calls right after the game to the same number.
CAROLINE: Lou Herrin. Who's that?
BOOTH: A sergeant in the State Cops. He exchanged blows with the v*ctim the night that he died.
CAROLINE: Make it official. Question the cop.
PEROTTA: Let's get some leverage on the guy first. Put him at the m*rder scene, get a warrant to test his DNA.
BOOTH: Here we go.
(Caroline stands up to leave)
CAROLINE: Get a warrant for this, Ms. Julian, get a warrant for that. You need grounds for a warrant, Cherie. Don't they teach that at Quantico anymore? What grounds have you got for that warrant? None! Nothing! You're just wishing.
(Caroline leaves)
BOOTH: I know how to get some bl*od out of this Herrin.
PEROTTA: Legally?
BOOTH: Yeah, of course legally. (stands)
PEROTTA: How?
BOOTH: Well, it's a big game tonight, right? And sometimes during a game... people bleed.
PEROTTA: (Sigh) I don't like it.
BOOTH: Then you don't have to show up.
(Cut to Booth sawing off his cast in the corridor outside of the ice rink locker room. Wendell comes out of locker room)
WENDELL: What are you doing, man?
BOOTH: What does it look like I'm doing?
WENDELL: You think that's a good idea? You got another couple of weeks on that cast.
BOOTH: Well, considering I can't play with a cast, then yeah, it's a great idea.
You clear about the plan?
WENDELL: Somebody bleeds, I collect a sample, put it in a bag, pass it off to Dr. Brennan.
BOOTH: Lou Herrin, number five, he's our prime suspect. And I gotta make him bleed.
(Cut to ice hockey players skating around. Perotta and Brennan seated in stands)
PEROTTA: You've worked with Booth for a while now, right?
BRENNAN: Mmm hmm PEROTTA: Is he the kind of guy that, uh, you know, I... Is he flirty?
BRENNAN: Flirty?
PEROTTA: Would you say he twinkles his eyes at all women?
BRENNAN: Twinkly eyes actually result when the pupils dilate very wide which is an unconscious result of intense interest or sexual attraction.
PEROTTA: So, no, he doesn't twinkle at everyone?
BRENNAN: No.
PEROTTA: All right.
(Wendell and Booth skating side by side)
WENDELL: Is that the guy?
BOOTH: That's him. Lou Herrin, number five.
WENDELL: You think he even knows how to bleed?
BOOTH: Just keep your head up, all right?
OPPOSITION: Come on, you should've called that. Pass it up!
(Booth knows a player down. Wendell collects a sample of his bl*od and gives it to Brennan. Booth knocks Lou Herrin down)
BOOTH: Keep your head up, Herrin.
(Booth knocks another player into the glass wall, leaving bl*od running down it Wendell collects a sample and gives it to Brennan. Booth smashes into Lou Herrin again)
LOU HERRIN: Man, what's your problem?
BOOTH: I got a little chip, all right? Just play your hockey ,pal. This guy's hard to get mad.
WENDELL: Man, he's maybe the only one who hasn't shed a drop.
(Booth and Lou Herrin pushing and shoving each other)
LOU HERRIN: Stay out of my face!
BOOTH: Keep your head up, huh!
(Lou Herrin smashes into Booth)
LOU HERRIN: Take a warning, pal.
BOOTH: (to Wendell) I think I'm finally getting to this guy.
WENDELL: Hope you survive it!
(Booth and Herrin pushing and elbowing each other. Booth hits Lou Herrin in the mouth. Lou Herrin stops, spits out bl*od and then chases Booth and smashes into him. Booth's helmet hits the ground and then Booth hits the back of his head on the ice)
(Booth changed to Philadelphia Flyers jersey. Luc Robitaille skates up and slides getting ice all over Booth's face)
LUC ROBITAILLE: Taking a little break?
BOOTH: Luc Robitaille?
LUC ROBITAILLE: Seeley Booth.
BOOTH: Right. (gets up and skates around)
LUC ROBITAILLE: Let's go, let's play.
BOOTH: Right. You're the greatest left-winger of all time.
LUC ROBITAILLE: And you're the best player on your team. For what that's worth. All right, let's go. Come on, let's play. Here we go. Come on, show me something! Hey, come on, move, move! Move, move, let's go!
BOOTH: Whoa, wait a second. I can't play hockey with you. I gotta solve a m*rder.
LUC ROBITAILLE: You know, Booth... it's not about the bl*od. (scores a goal)
BOOTH: It's our best forensic clue.
LUC ROBITAILLE: Forget the bl*od.
BOOTH: Then what?
LUC ROBITAILLE: You know what makes a team. Look at the team.
It's about what brings a team together.
BOOTH: The team. Look at the team.
LUC ROBITAILLE: All right, let's go, one on one. Let's see what you got. Come on, B.
(Booth skates towards Luc Robitaille, checks into him and falls onto his back again)
BOOTH: Geez, ugh. I thought I could get by you there, you know?
LUC ROBITAILLE: You'll never get by me.
BOOTH: Right.
LUC ROBITAILLE: Now, listen, Booth, you're not your father, okay? You protect the ones you care about, on the ice and off the ice. That's who you are. You're not your father. You're not your father.
BRENNAN: Booth?
LUC ROBITAILLE: (echoing) You're not your father.
BRENNAN: Booth? Booth? Booth?
(Brennan standing over Booth)
BOOTH: Bones, what are you doing on the ice?
BRENNAN: I get nervous when you fall down and don't get up. Come up here.
WENDELL: Up you go, buddy.
BRENNAN: Come on.
(Brennan and Wendell help Booth to stand up)
WENDELL: Don't worry, I got the bl*od.
BOOTH: (to Wendell) Good work, Bones.
BRENNAN: But I'm Bones.
(Cut to Medico Legal Lab - Workroom. Hodgins running blender running with red mush in. Angela enters)
ANGELA: Smells like fish in here.
HODGINS: Yep. It's the v*ctim's goldfish. They died of ammonia poisoning.
ANGELA: How did that happen?
HODGINS: I don't know. Maybe the v*ctim washed his aquarium with window cleaner? I don't know. How are things with you and Roxie?
ANGELA: Uh, good... good. Taking it slow, you know. Letting things unfold in a... Are you seeing anybody?
HODGINS: I, um... actually went out on a date last night.
ANGELA: I'm glad to hear that.
HODGINS: Any little twinge there?
ANGELA: Definitely a little twinge, yeah, but...despite the twinge, I'm glad you're back in the saddle.
HODGINS: Oh, I'm not back in the saddle exactly. It was just a first date. Barely got out of the barn.
ANGELA: You saw the v*ctim's apartment, right?
HODGINS: Yes... yeah. Yeah, it was a pigsty.
ANGELA: I don't think that guy cleaned anything. Not with ammonia. Not with anything.
(Cut to Brennan's office. Booth sat on sofa with ice bag on his head with Brennan standing by him. Sweets enters and sits down.)
SWEETS: I came as soon as I heard Booth had a brain injury. What part of your head hurts?
BOOTH: The part above my shoulders.
BRENNAN: The doctor said he has a concussion. He shouldn't fall asleep. Otherwise, not serious.
BOOTH: Tell him about the hallucination.
SWEETS: You hallucinated?
BOOTH: Luc Robitaille gave me advice.
BRENNAN: You got advice on a m*rder case from...
SWEETS: What did he say?
BOOTH: He said, "Don't worry about the... the player's bl*od."
SWEETS: That's very interesting.
BOOTH: Lucky Luc told me to look in a different direction.
SWEETS: That's interesting.
BOOTH: Stop saying that... just stop.
(Cam enters)
CAM: Preliminary DNA tests show that the bl*od mixed in with the v*ctim's did not belong to Lou Herrin.
BOOTH: Lucky Luc was right.
CAM: All that means is that you got your brains scrambled for nothing.
BOOTH: Lucky Luc is never wrong.
SWEETS: This hallucination could be, uh, Booth's subconscious speaking to him through the voice and image of someone that he idolizes.
BRENNAN: Like a modern version of a Vision Quest?
BOOTH: You know what, hallucination or not... (stands) Lucky Luc, he told me something about myself that... He told me something.
SWEETS: I'd be very interested in knowing what he said.
BOOTH: Lucky for me, you're never gonna find out because Bones is gonna drive me home and get me soup.
(Booth and Brennan leave the office)
(Cut to Hodgins and Wendell in Pete Carlson's apartment)
HODGINS: There has got to be some reason these fish died of ammonia poison.
WENDELL: Last time I did this, I ended up in juvie hall over the weekend.
HODGINS: What?
WENDELL: What? Uh, nothing.
HODGINS: Whoa, wow. Oh wow. (pulls jewellery out of bottom of t*nk) Buried treasure.
WENDELL: What do we do now?
HODGINS: Find out why the hell he was hiding jewellery in a fish t*nk.
(Cut to FBI meeting room)
CAROLINE: Have any of you ever heard of something called "chain of evidence"?
PEROTTA: Ms. Julian...
CAROLINE: Why didn't you go with these two idiots to the v*ctim's home?
CAM: Please don't call my people idiots.
HODGINS: We're not idiots.
WENDELL: I feel like an idiot.
CAM: You don't speak right now-- neither of you. It's a crime scene. My people are very often at crime scenes. It's what we do.
CAROLINE: No, it's not. You've got it in your heads that you're crime scene types. This is Booth's fault for indulging your fantasies. You are not crime scene types. You are lab rats.
CAM: No chain of evidence was broken. When Dr. Hodgins and Mr. Bray found the items, they immediately called me. I called Booth, and when his head hurt too much to talk to me, I called Agent Perotta.
PEROTTA: Ms. Julian...
CAROLINE: What?
PEROTTA: A photograph of dead fish led them to this. I think that kind of brilliance is worth it.
CAROLINE: You've been taken hostage by the squints, Agent Perotta. Turns out these items were reported destroyed in a fire.
HODGINS: The v*ctim was a fireman.
WENDELL: The FBI could check to see if the Firedawgs put out that fire.
HODGINS: Stole from the fire, cleaned off with ammonia.
WENDELL: Hidden in the aquarium, k*ll the fish.
CAM: Okay. Now you are straying out of your territory.
CAROLINE: No, they got it right. The bracelet Agents Booth and Perotta recovered from the v*ctim's loan shark was reported destroyed by that same fire.
PEROTTA: My people were right.
CAM, CAROLINE, WENDELL AND HODGINS: Your people?
WENDELL AND HODGINS: We're Booth's people.
(Cut to Booth's apartment. Booth looking at photos and names on his laptop)
BOOTH: They're on the Firedawgs, but they also played on the same high school team. What brings them together, eh?
(Brennan comes in through the door)
BRENNAN: I'm back.
BOOTH: Hey, what brings them together? What brings the team together?
BRENNAN: So, I got the soup from the place. And, yes, I told Mama that it was for you especially.
BOOTH: It's all about the team there. It's all...
BRENNAN: What are you doing?
BOOTH: It's all about the team there. Bones, it's all about the team there. They...these four guys...they all played hockey together in high school, and now they all play together as a team.
BRENNAN: They're all firemen?
BOOTH: Yeah. They all worked the jewellery store fire. One of these three guys is the m*rder.
BRENNAN: According to Mr. Lucky?
BOOTH: It's Luc, okay? It is... it... it's not Mr. Lucky. It is Luc Robitaille. Left wing. Great sh*t. Luc Robitaille-- he's one of the best left wings of all time.
BRENNAN: (picking up spike) What is this?
BOOTH: It's a lace puller. Why?
BRENNAN: I think it might be the m*rder w*apon.
(Cut to interrogation room. Brennan sat on one side of the table, with Dave Simms, Alex Pinna and Ed Fralic on the other side. Booth standing behind Brennan. Perotta enters)
PEROTTA: We want to discuss the jewellery store fire.
ALEX PINNA: I want a lawyer.
DAVE SIMMS: What for, Alex? We didn't do anything wrong. None of us did.
BOOTH: What about Pete?
PEROTTA: He break some kind of fireman code, something like that? (Sits)
ED FRALIC: Yeah, something like that.
ALEX PINNA: I've got nothing to say about any of this. I want a lawyer.
BRENNAN: We know Carlson was b*at with a hockey stick, after which a lace puller entered his brain through his eye and k*ll him.
BOOTH: What about your dream, Ed? You were gonna play for the NHL, right? "Local player scouted by the NHL." Look at that one. Oh, this one's good, too. "Fralic's hat trick wins game."
ED FRALIC: I got injured.
BRENNAN: This injury would end any chance of a career in professional hockey.
DAVE SIMMS: What does that have to do with anything?
ED FRALIC: Look, I got hurt, now I sell siding, and I play hockey on the weekends.
ALEX PINNA: Why you got to rub his face in the past?
BOOTH: Who ruined you?
ED: Pete Carlson. It was Pete.
BOOTH: You all knew about the stolen jewellery.
PEROTTA: The question is, how many of you were there the night he was k*ll?
DAVE SIMMS: None of us. Nobody here had anything to do with that.
BRENNAN: We have the hockey stick, the m*rder w*apon and DNA.
BOOTH: It's only a matter of time.
ED FRALIC: Yeah.
DAVE SIMMS: What?
ED: It was me. I asked to meet Pete on the ice after everybody left. I told him to give back the stolen jewellery, and he said to me... He said to me that I was a... a coward. That I didn't do anything to him back in the day when he wrecked my life and I wouldn't do anything to him now. Well, he was wrong.
(Cut to ice rink - Brennan and Booth skating)
BRENNAN: I'm not positive this is a good idea.
BOOTH: Oh, I got you! I got you. Stay up here. (Brennan falls down) Okay, it's all right. Here we go, one more. (Booth picks Brennan up) Well, you know what, I got to stay up all night, so who better to keep me company than you?
BRENNAN: You and me skating is saving you from slipping into a coma?
BOOTH: Oh, easy, Bones. Now I'm gonna go down.
BRENNAN: I have a lot of natural athletic ability.
BOOTH: Oh, yeah, natural. I can... I can see that. Real smooth and natural. That's it. Well done.
BRENNAN: That Agent Perotta, she really enjoyed working with us.
BOOTH: Yeah.
BRENNAN: But, um... you're the only FBI agent I want to work with. Will you tell me what the Lucky Luciano told you?
BOOTH: He's not an Italian opera singer. Bones, why do you always say that wrong? You do it on purpose, don't you?
(Booth and Brennan skating holding hands)
BRENNAN: I would like to know what he said.
BOOTH: He said that I'm not like my old man. He said I'm made of better stuff.
BRENNAN: Well... I don't know your old man, your father, but... I think you're made of very, very good stuff.
BOOTH: Hey, you know what? Forget about Agent Perotta, all right? Nothing's gonna change between me and you.
BRENNAN: Well, entropy is a natural force that pulls everything apart at a subatomic level. Everything changes.
(Booth pushing Brennan on the ice)
BOOTH: Not everything, Bones.
BRENNNAN: Don't.
BOOTH: Not everything.
BRENNAN: You're gonna make me fall.
BOOTH: I'm never gonna make you fall. I'm always here.
BOOTH: Here comes the big spin. (laughter fade out)
END.
